The allegations of this Complaint are based on the knowledge of Plaintiff as to itself and the 
investigation of counsel, including the review of publicly available information and documents. 
NATURE AND SUMMARY OF THE ACTION 
1.
Most of the world learned of Jeffrey Epstein’s horrific abuses of women and 
children in 2019, when Epstein was arrested for orchestrating a wide-ranging human trafficking 
enterprise.  Others, however—including those that facilitated Epstein’s enterprise—knew of his 
abusive behavior for more than a decade earlier.  JP Morgan was one such facilitator.  JP Morgan 
served as Epstein’s primary bank from at least 1998 to 2013, during which time he operated as 
many as 55 accounts: some in his own name, some in the name of shell companies and sham non-
profits, and some in the names of his victims, associates, and recruiters.   
2.
For nearly fifteen years, Epstein relied on these accounts to abuse women and 
children.  Epstein used his JP Morgan accounts to transfer money to recruiters that trafficked new 
victims and to withdraw vast amounts of cash to pay off his victims.  During certain periods, 
Epstein reportedly withdrew up to $80,000 in cash multiple times a month; he once withdrew more 
than $750,000 in cash in a single year.  Epstein is now infamous for using cash to pay his victims, 
and his extraordinary cash withdrawals were obviously suspicious even without knowledge of his 
abusive conduct. 
3.
But JP Morgan knew of Epstein’s abusive conduct many years before his arrest, 
and internally held deep concerns about precisely why Epstein was withdrawing vast amounts of 
cash and transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars to “modeling” agencies.  As early as 2006, 
when Epstein was arrested for solicitation of a minor, JP Morgan knew not only that Epstein was 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 2 of 53

3 
abusing young women and children, but that he paid his victims in cash—something that one of 
JP Morgan’s top executives has admitted.  In 2008, in 2010, and multiple times in 2011, JP 
Morgan’s employees internally shared reports about Epstein’s abuses and expressed concern about 
the Bank’s ongoing relationship with him.  In 2011, JP Morgan employees explicitly questioned 
whether a previous payment to a “model management” agency was “payment for services as a 
procurer.”  
4.
Knowledge of Epstein’s abusive conduct extended to the very top of the Company’s 
C-suite.  Most notoriously, Jes Staley (who, until 2013, served as the chief executive officer 
(“CEO”) of JP Morgan’s Investment Bank) shared a deep personal friendship with Epstein.  
Although JP Morgan is now attempting to lay all blame for its institutional failures on Staley alone 
in an attempt to escape legal and reputational harm, it is clear that Staley could not have sustained 
and concealed a 15+ year banking relationship involving tens of millions of dollars without the 
knowledge and assistance of others within JP Morgan.  Mary Erdoes (who has served as CEO of 
JP Morgan’s Asset & Wealth Management division) paid numerous visits to Epstein’s home and 
has admitted that she and JP Morgan knew of Epstein’s abuses by 2006.  Erdoes is known as a top 
lieutenant to the Bank’s longtime CEO, Jamie Dimon.  And Dimon himself appears to have been 
personally involved in sanctioning the Bank’s relationship with Epstein: one August 2008 
document references Epstein’s $120 million with JP Morgan being in question “pending Dimon 
review.”  
5.
Despite this top-to-bottom knowledge, JP Morgan’s Board did nothing.  JP Morgan 
knew that Epstein was a serial abuser that relied heavily on cash payments, and that Epstein 
regularly withdrew vast sums of cash from his JP Morgan accounts.  But upon information and 
belief, JP Morgan consistently failed to file suspicious activity reports (“SARs”) that it was 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 3 of 53

4 
required to file when it suspected potential criminal activity—as it clearly did.  This failure 
persisted through Epstein’s entire 15+ year history with the Bank, and persisted for years even 
after JP Morgan terminated Epstein’s accounts in 2013.  This failure persisted, in fact, through the 
time of Epstein’s final arrest in 2019, until which time Epstein continued to commit his prolific 
abuses.   
6.
This failure to file SARs and otherwise comply with similar anti-money laundering 
(“AML”) and know-your-customer (“KYC”) regulations is nothing new for JP Morgan.  Rather, 
it is a symptom of a broader, years-long failure of governance and oversight by JP Morgan’s board 
of directors—a failure for which JP Morgan was previously cited and penalized by regulators, in 
2013 and 2014.  In 2013, both the OCC and the Federal Reserve accused JP Morgan of failing to 
comply with federal AML laws and regulations, including because the Bank failed to file timely 
SARs.  JM Morgan was hit with a $350 million sanction in 2014 due to its continuing AML 
compliance failures.  Not only did the Company face civil penalties, it was faced criminal liability 
as well:  the Bank pleaded guilty in 2014 to two felony counts relating to failures to comply with 
AML rules, including the failure to file SARs. 
7.
Now, JP Morgan is exposed to substantial legal risk due its role in helping conceal 
Epstein’s crimes.  One of Epstein’s victims, identified only as “Jane Doe 1”, has brought several 
claims (on behalf of herself and other victims) against the Bank for its role in Epstein’s abuse of 
her.  The government of the U.S. Virgin Islands has also initiated litigation against the Bank for 
similar reasons, and is seeking significant monetary damages, including punitive and treble 
damages.   
8.
All told, JP Morgan has suffered and will continue to suffer substantial monetary 
and reputational harm for its longstanding role in assisting the most egregious sex trafficker in 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 4 of 53

modern history.  Had JP Morgan’s Board and senior officers taken their oversight responsibilities 
seriously, JP Morgan would have consistently reported Epstein’s suspicious practices and would 
have terminated its relationship with him much sooner than it actually did.  Plaintiff brings this 
action on behalf of JP Morgan to hold these directors and officers to account for their longstanding 
governance failures.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
43.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
45.
JP Morgan is currently defending allegations from two distinct lawsuits stemming 
from its facilitation and concealment of Epstein’s abuse.  First, a plaintiff identified as “Jane Doe 
1”, on behalf of herself and other victims of Epstein’s abuse, asserted several claims against the 
Company’s primary banking subsidiary, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., in the litigation styled Jane 
Doe 1 v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 22-cv-10019 (JSR) (“Doe v. JP Morgan”).  Second, the 
government of the U.S. Virgin Islands also asserted several claims against JP Morgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. in the litigation styled Government of the United States Virgin Islands v. JP Morgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., 22-cv-10904 (CSR) (“USVI v. JP Morgan”).   
46.
In both actions, the plaintiffs broadly allege that for several years, JP Morgan knew 
about Epstein’s abusive conduct and knew about Epstein’s suspicious use of his many accounts at 
the Bank, yet failed to comply with federal regulations to report his suspicious activity.  This failure 
and concealment, in turn, helped Epstein’s systematic abuse to continue unchecked.  Plaintiffs in 
both actions seek monetary damages, including punitive and treble damages in the USVI v. JP 
Morgan action.  JP Morgan therefore faces a material risk of substantial monetary liability, above 
and beyond the significant reputational harm that JP Morgan has already suffered and will continue 
to suffer as a result of its longstanding facilitation and concealment of Epstein’s crimes.  JP Morgan 
also faces the risk of fines or monetary damages as the result of potential governmental 
investigations into its conduct. 
SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS 
I.
EPSTEIN’S DECADES OF ABUSIVE CONDUCT
47.
The shocking extent and gravity of Epstein’s abuses are now well known.  For more 
than two decades, Epstein operated a vast network of shell companies, intermediaries, and enablers 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 10 of 53

11 
for the sole purpose of trafficking and abusing young women at his properties, including in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands.   
48.
Epstein is reported to have begun his systematic exploitation of young women as 
early as the 1990s.  But since at least 2001, Epstein trafficked young girls and women to the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, where he then had them transported to his private island, Little St. James.1  He also 
trafficked women to New York and to other properties he owned.  Epstein and his associates often 
deceived these girls and young women into traveling with promises of modeling contracts, 
employment, or educational opportunities.  Other times, Epstein’s abuse began as a demand for a 
massage, which rapidly evolved into abuse.  Once trafficked to the U.S. Virgin Islands, Epstein 
and others in his network exploited and abused these women, and then ensured their silence with 
both threats and payoffs.  Epstein was infamous for paying his victims in cash, although he on 
occasion also wired money directly to both victims and allies.2
49.
The full scale of Epstein’s abuses is hard to comprehend.  Epstein is accused of 
trafficking and abusing girls as young as 11 years old, reflecting his repulsive preference of the 
“younger the better.”3  Air traffic controllers and other airport personnel in the U.S. Virgin Islands 
reported seeing Epstein disembark from his plane with girls that appeared to be between 11 and 
18 years old.  In one harrowing instance, a 15 year old victim that Epstein abused on Little St.

Compl. (Nov. 30, 2022) at ¶49 (hereinafter “USVI State Complaint”).

2023) at ¶126 (hereinafter “Doe Complaint”).

12 
James attempted to escape by swimming off the island.  Epstein organized a search party, found 
the victim, confiscated her passport, and threatened her with physical harm if she did not submit.4
50.
Epstein trafficked many of his victims from Eastern Europe and sometimes kept 
the same girls and women in servitude for several years.  For example, Epstein is accused of having 
flown one victim to his island dozens of times between 2004 and 2017; and another more than 50 
times between 2000 and 2002.  This meant that Epstein eventually had to grapple with immigration 
concerns.  To address this problem, Epstein forced some of his victims to marry his American 
citizen associates (or even other victims), and then helped finalize arrangements with immigration 
authorities.5  Epstein is accused of having forced at least three victims into marriages, and then 
threatening them with harm if they attempted to leave. 
51.
Epstein’s appetite for abuse was seemingly insatiable.  Epstein is reported to have 
regularly abused up to 3-4 victims each day—a demand that even Epstein’s extensive network 
struggled to supply.  Epstein therefore demanded that his victims themselves help deceive and 
recruit other victims.  To this end, Epstein often instructed his victims to go to night clubs or on 
shopping trips to help identify other unsuspecting women and girls that they might be able to 
entrap.  Epstein paid an additional fee for each new victim that an existing victim lured in. 
52.
The frequency and duration of his crimes make clear that Epstein could not have 
orchestrated his abuse without both an extensive network of allies and enablers, and steady, 
unquestioned access to large amounts of cash.  In JP Morgan, Epstein had both.

II.
JP MORGAN ENABLED EPSTEIN’S CRIMES FOR YEARS
53.
Epstein was a JP Morgan client from at least 1998 through 2013.  Over this time, 
JP Morgan serviced roughly 55 accounts that belonged or were related to Epstein, collectively 
worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  In addition to accounts in his own name, Epstein also 
operated many JP Morgan accounts in the names of other companies and non-profit entities that 
often had no legitimate business purpose.  These entities included 2013 Butterfly Trust, Coatue 
Enterprises, LLC, C.O.U.Q. Foundation, Enhanced Education, Financial Trust Company, Inc., 
HBRK Associates, Inc., Hyperion Air, Inc, JEGE, Inc., JEGE, LLC, NES, LLC, Plan D, LLC, 
Southern Financial, LLC, and Southern Trust Company, each of which had accounts with JP 
Morgan.  Epstein used many of these entities to make and conceal payments to his victims and his 
associates or, as the U.S. Virgin Islands alleges, to help shield his assets from judgment. 
54.
Over the many years that Epstein served as a star JP Morgan client, he used his 55+ 
accounts with the Bank extensively to facilitate his abuse.  According to the U.S. Virgin Islands 
government, Epstein paid at least 20 of his victims through JP Morgan accounts, and these victims 
collectively received in excess of $1 million.  Epstein also used his JP Morgan accounts to pay his 
associates and enablers: the U.S. Virgin Islands government alleges that Epstein paid nearly $1.5 
million to known recruiters.  
55.
The details of these enormous payments are deeply troubling.  Epstein paid the 
plaintiff identified as Jane Doe 1, for example, more than $600,000 through his JP Morgan 
accounts between 2003 and 2013.  Epstein’s abuse of Doe 1 began when she was only 14 years 
old.6  In an obvious sign that something was amiss, Doe 1 listed Epstein’s New York City 
townhouse as her address for purposes of the many payments she received from Epstein.   
6 USVI Complaint, ¶66. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 13 of 53

14 
56.
More troublingly, Epstein also regularly withdrew millions of dollars from his JP 
Morgan accounts—in cash.  As early as 2006, a JP Morgan Rapid Response Team noted that 
Epstein routinely withdrew $40,000 to $80,000 in cash from his accounts several times each 
month, and more than $750,000 per year.  In each of 2004 and 2005, Epstein withdrew more than 
$800,000 in cash.  Epstein also used his JP Morgan accounts to make at least 95 foreign remittances 
to unknown payees—another blatantly suspicious pattern of conduct.   
57.
Some of Epstein’s use of cash is so obviously illegitimate that it almost defies 
belief.  For example, the company that owned and operated Epstein’s private plane (Hyperion Air, 
Inc.) issued more than $547,000 in checks—payable to cash—for “fuel expenses when traveling 
to foreign countries.”7  Apart from the absurdity of paying for hundreds of thousands of dollars’ 
worth of jet fuel in cash, some of these checks were issued when Epstein was under house arrest,8
and plainly unable to travel anywhere.   
58.
Similarly, between January 2012 and June 2013, Hyperion converted more than 
$120,000 into foreign currency, with the constituent cash withdrawals either exceeding the typical 
$10,000 reporting threshold, or being structured in a way to avoid meeting this threshold.  Epstein 
also used other entities under his control to funnel payments to his victims and associates.  For 
example, Epstein used a charitable organization he controlled (and which had an account with JP 
Morgan) to pay $29,464 to three young women, and used another organization to pay $124,232 to 
Leslie Wexner, who is now known to have been a vital part of Epstein’s network.

minor for prostitution, and entered into a plea agreement in 2008.

III.
JP MORGAN WILLFULLY IGNORED AND FAILED TO REPORT EPSTEIN’S 
HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS PRACTICES 
59.
JP Morgan knew of Epstein’s true nature at least as early as 2006.  The previous 
year, press reports emerged that claimed that Epstein paid a 14-year old girl in Palm Beach, Florida 
for a massage and then proceeded to abuse her.  These press reports prompted other Epstein victims 
to come forward with similar allegations.  In 2006, Epstein was arrested and indicted in Florida 
for solicitation of a minor, amidst additional extensive press reports about his crimes. 
60.
JP Morgan was immediately aware of Epstein’s arrest.  In 2006, the same year 
Epstein was arrested, JP Morgan’s Global Corporate Security Division found “[s]everal newspaper 
articles … that detail the indictment of Jeffrey Epstein in Florida on felony charges of soliciting 
underage prostitutes”9 (i.e. raping children).  Despite these reports and Epstein’s indictment, JP 
Morgan decided to retain Epstein as a client—while concluding that his account “should be 
classified as high risk” and require special approval.10
61.
JP Morgan’s knowledge of Epstein’s crimes at this time was not limited to lower-
level employees, but extended all the way to the top.  At her deposition in the USVI v. JP Morgan 
action, Mary Erdoes (who was CEO of JP Morgan Private Bank from 2005 until she became CEO 
of the Asset & Wealth Management Division in 2009) admitted that JP Morgan was aware in 2006 
not only that Epstein was abusing women and underage girls, but that Epstein paid these victims 
in cash.  Crucially, this was the same year that a team at JP Morgan made an internal report that 
Epstein was withdrawing up to $80,000 in cash at a time, multiple times a month.

10 USVI Complaint, ¶44. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 15 of 53

16 
62.
In 2008, Epstein pled guilty to several of the charges that he faced in Florida, 
including solicitation of a minor for prostitution.  As part of his plea arrangement, Epstein was 
sentenced to serve 18 months in jail and was required to register as a sex offender.11  To the extent 
JP Morgan had any doubts about the allegations against Epstein in 2006, Epstein’s guilty plea in 
2008 erased them.  
63.
Internally, Epstein’s guilty plea led some of JP Morgan’s employees to assume that 
the Bank would immediately terminate its sprawling relationship with the now-convicted sex 
trafficker.  But they would be mistaken, as JP Morgan’s senior-most executives decided to 
maintain this lucrative, if problematic, relationship.  In August 2008, a JP Morgan employee wrote 
that she “would count Epstein’s assets as a probable outflow for ’08 ($120mm or so?) as I can’t 
imagine it will stay (pending [Jamie] Dimon review).”12
64.
Given that JP Morgan continued to service Epstein’s accounts for at least five more 
years, the “Dimon review” evidently resulted in a decision not to take any action against Epstein 
following his guilty plea but, rather, to retain the lucrative relationship.  The same year, in a 
reflection of JP Morgan’s decision to brush off Epstein’s known crimes, Erdoes received an email 
asking her whether Epstein was at an event “with miley cyrus”—who was only 16 years old at the 
time.13
65.
Press reports about Epstein’s abusive conduct continued to emerge in subsequent 
years, and JP Morgan compliance employees continued to express concerns about the Bank’s 
11 Epstein’s full non-prosecution agreement with Florida became public in 2009.  This agreement 
alleged that Epstein trafficked and engaged in illicit sexual conduct with minors, including across 
state lines.

13 USVI Complaint, ¶95.

17 
continued patronage of someone with Epstein’s history.  In 2010, JP Morgan learned of even more 
allegations in the press against Epstein, detailing his trafficking of women and minors for abuse.  
In an internal email, an employee in JP Morgan’s risk management division referred to “new 
allegations of an investigation related to child trafficking,” and asked whether the Bank was “still 
comfortable with this client who is now a registered sex offender.”14  Other JP Morgan compliance 
employees decided that Epstein “should go.”15  But reflecting the Bank’s fundamental attitude to 
Epstein’s crimes, a different JP Morgan risk management employee dismissed these disturbing 
reports as routine: “In my short tenure working on the account these stories pop up including these 
from the summer.”16
66.
The next year, in January 2011, JP Morgan once again was made keenly aware of 
yet more allegations of human trafficking against Epstein.  And yet again, JP Morgan brushed off 
the allegations.  That month, JP Morgan conducted a review of Epstein’s accounts because a “few 
news stories during 2010 connect[ed] Jeffrey Epstein to human trafficking.”17  The U.S. Virgin 
Islands alleges that JP Morgan’s coverage team “met to discuss the situation and agreed to enhance 
monitoring and document a discussion with the client.”18  Unsurprisingly, Defendant Jes Staley—
the CEO of JP Morgan’s Investment Bank who seemingly participated in Epstein’s crimes, as 
discussed in Section IV below—was the JP Morgan executive that the Bank entrusted to hold this 
“discussion” with Epstein.  Also unsurprisingly, Epstein claimed “there was no truth to the

18 
allegations” against him and “no evidence.”19  JP Morgan internally concluded that it would 
“continue to monitor the accounts and cash usage closely going forward.”20
67.
In other words, JP Morgan knew that Epstein was a convicted sexual offender who 
heavily relied on his cash to pay his victims and his associates.  JP Morgan also knew that Epstein 
regularly withdrew huge amounts of cash from his many accounts with the Bank.  Yet JP Morgan’s 
response was to simply “monitor” Epstein’s already-extraordinary “cash usage,” rather than take 
any measures to report his blatantly suspicious transactions to the authorities.  In a hint that Epstein 
was too large of a client for JP Morgan to take action against, the Bank had granted Epstein a new 
$50 million line of credit only weeks earlier, in December 2010. 
68.
Only two months later, JP Morgan’s Global Corporate Security Division internally 
circulated even more devastating reports about Epstein’s abuses.  In March 2011, this division 
reported that “[n]umerous articles detail various law enforcement agencies investigating Jeffrey 
Epstein for allegedly participating, directly or indirectly, in child trafficking and molesting 
underage girls.”21  Even more damningly, this report also noted that Epstein had “settled a dozen 
civil lawsuits out of court from his victims regarding solicitation.”22  This made it abundantly clear 
to JP Morgan that Epstein was not a one-off offender—he was a prolific, serial abuser of women 
and girls that he paid through his many JP Morgan bank accounts. 
69.
This same March 2011 report also noted that a company named “MC2 Model 
Management and Jeffrey Epstein engaged in racketeering that involved luring in minor children

19 
for sexual play for money,” and that MC2’s owner was a “frequent passenger on Epstein’s private 
jet and often visited Epstein in jail.”23  Worse, the report noted that Epstein paid MC2 $1 million 
in 2005, and that it was “unknown if the money was given as a secret investment or payment for 
services as a procurer.”24
70.
JP Morgan was plainly concerned that Epstein was using his accounts with the Bank 
to “procure” ever more victims.  This concern within the Bank soon also spread to others within 
Epstein’s orbit.  Although most of the public learned of Ghislaine Maxwell’s key role in Epstein’s 
abuses only after her arrest in 2019, JP Morgan suspected her involvement years earlier.  In August 
2011, Maxwell applied to open a new account with JP Morgan for a “personal recruitment 
consulting business.”25  Internally, JP Morgan’s AML director asked: “What does she mean by 
personal recruitment?? Are you sure this will have nothing to do with Jeffrey? If you want to 
proceed, I suggest that we flag this as a High Risk Client.”26  While it is unclear how JP Morgan 
may have treated Maxwell internally, the Bank plainly did not ever report Maxwell’s suspicious 
“recruitment” activities to regulators.  
71.
Also in 2011, a senior JP Morgan compliance official who reviewed the Bank’s 
relationship with Epstein warned that there was “[l]ots of smoke” and “[l]ots of questions” 
surrounding Epstein’s criminal behavior.27  According to the U.S. Virgin Islands’ complaint 
against JP Morgan, these included that:


Epstein “is alleged to be involved in the human trafficking of young 
girls and law enforcement is also allegedly investigating his 
involvement in this activity.” 

“He is also an alleged personal associate of the CEO of the 
Investment Bank (Jes Staley).” 

“AML Operations went to a [Private Bank] risk meeting late last 
week requesting that we exit this relationship.”

“[W]hether Epstein if further exposed could have a potential serious 
impact.”

“The one new concerning thing is the one article about the DOJ 
investigation is saying they brought under age girls to the US via a 
modeling agency M2 that is owned by a guy named Brunel. Turns 
out the banker said today we extended Epstein a loan in relation to 
this modeling agency.”  The writer claims that the agency is “legit” 
and that “it would be hard for us to tell” if “girls were exploited via 
their contract or arrangement.”  The loan was a letter of credit 
provided by JP Morgan to MC2 Model Management. 

In 2004, Epstein sponsored private bank accounts and credit cards 
for two 18 year olds “that appear to be part of his inner entourage.  
One is mentioned in many of the recaps of the escapades as a willing 
participant and assistant when hosting visitors.  She has received 
about 450,000 since opening from Epstein . . . . Both can be put in 
Palm Beach during 2004, by way of debit charges, which was when 
most allegations were from . . . . He did pay other girls, many models 
no huge amounts.  Sugar Daddy!” 

“His foundation account did pay donations to the Palm Beach Police 
Dept as reported just before the case started.  The same foundation 
account did pay monies direct to models and payments direct to 
specialty schools (massage, culinary) and university’s on behalf of 
models/aspiring actresses.  Nothing was astronomical.” 

“His business accounts Fiduciary we saw no client activity.  I know 
his biggest client, Wexner parted ways when he was convicted.  His

money but never says who.  I would like to know if in fact he is 
managing anyone’s money at this point or is it all his money.  We 
saw no evidence of disbursements even in the rocky years 08-09.  
When the well to do were running to their mattresses, he did not 
have any distributions from his accounts at Bear or JP.  He does have 
money at other institutions so maybe it happened there.”

USVI v. JP Morgan Complaint, ¶98. 
72.
Despite unequivocally knowing that Epstein was a serial sex offender, and despite 
the obviously suspicious nature of Epstein’s activity with the Bank, JP Morgan took no corrective 
action against Epstein for years.  Finally, in 2013, JP Morgan terminated its relationship with 
Epstein; it continued to do business with him for several years afterward (as detailed below).  The 
year that JP Morgan terminated Epstein’s accounts, the Bank noted that “[p]er bank policy, felons 
are considered high risk and require additional approval.”28  Epstein had been a convicted felon 
for almost a decade before his banking accounts were terminated.  That the Company left the 
accounts in place for so long, despite such deeply troubling, public accounts of his crimes, suggests 
either that the Bank’s senior-most executives reviewed and approved Epstein’s ongoing 
relationship with the Bank despite knowing about his crimes; or the Bank’s oversight system 
failed, allowing Epstein’s abusive conduct to continue unchecked.   
IV.
JP MORGAN’S SENIOR-MOST EXECUTIVES SUPERVISED THE BANK’S 
RELATIONSHIP WITH EPSTEIN, EVEN YEARS AFTER JP MORGAN 
TERMINATED EPSTEIN’S ACCOUNTS 
73.
JP Morgan was clearly fully aware of Epstein’s abusive conduct, and its lower-level 
employees held deep concerns about the Bank’s ever-deeper relationship with Epstein.  But JP 
Morgan’s senior-most executives did not share this concern—and this extends far beyond just 
Defendant Staley, Epstein’s close friend and apparent fellow abuser (as discussed infra), whom JP 
Morgan is now attempting to hold solely responsible for its longstanding failures.  Mary Erdoes—
who currently serves as the CEO of JP Morgan’s Asset and Wealth Management division—visited 
Epstein at his New York home in both 2011 and 2013.  Erdoes is also reported to have exchanged 
28 USVI Complaint, ¶50. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 21 of 53

22 
“dozens of emails” with Epstein, including with regard to a charitable fund that JP Morgan 
considered launching together with Epstein.29  Similarly, John Duffy—who served as Vice 
Chairman of JP Morgan and as the CEO of JP Morgan’s private bank for ultrawealthy clients—
also visited Epstein at his New York home in April 2013.  Just one month later, the private bank 
that Duffy ran re-authorized Epstein to borrow money against his accounts, despite JP Morgan’s 
compliance officials’ repeated warnings about Epstein’s suspicious practices and criminal 
behavior.  Another senior JP Morgan executive who worked at the private bank, Justin Nelson, 
visited Epstein’s New York home around six times between 2014-2017—after the bank 
supposedly terminated Epstein’s accounts.  Nelson also visited Epstein at his ranch in New Mexico 
in 2016.  Defendant Kessler—who was a member of the Board from 1995 to 2007⸺was former 
college classmates, close friends and business partners with Epstein’s main benefactor, Leslie 
Wexner (“Wexner”), with whom Kessler co-founded a real estate development business.  Wexner, 
a multibillionaire, has been called Epstein’s “biggest client” and likely helped provide Epstein with 
a substantial part of the wealth that enabled his scheme of sexual abuse and predation.  
74.
These ties pale in comparison, however, to Defendant Staley’s intimate—and 
potentially criminal—relationship with Epstein.  Staley led JP Morgan’s Private Banking division 
(which was later run by Duffy) from 1999-2001, during which time he formed a close relationship 
with Epstein.  Staley later served as the CEO of JP Morgan’s Asset Management division from 
2001 until 2009, and was then promoted in 2009 to serve as the CEO of JP Morgan’s Investment 
Bank.  Staley left JP Morgan in 2013: the same year that the bank terminated Epstein’s accounts.  
75.
Between 2008 and 2013, Staley used his JP Morgan email account to exchange 
some 1,200 emails with Epstein, reflecting the deep bond the two men shared.  Some of these

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 22 of 53

23 
emails suggest that Staley may have participated in or taken advantage of Epstein’s criminal 
trafficking operation.  In December 2008, for example, Epstein and Staley discussed Staley visiting 
Epstein at his residence in Palm Beach.  Although Epstein was not going to be in Palm Beach at 
the time, Epstein invited Staley to use his house.  In early January 2009, around the time that Staley 
was staying at Epstein’s house in Palm Beach, Epstein wired $2,000 from his JP Morgan account 
to a woman with an Eastern European surname.  (Many of the women that Epstein trafficked were 
from Eastern Europe).  
76.
Later that same year, Epstein and Staley again discussed getting together, this time 
in London.30  In late August 2009, Epstein asked Staley whether he would need anything while he 
was in London; Staley said yes.  Just two days later, Epstein again used his JP Morgan account to 
wire $3,000 to the same woman he had paid while Staley was in Palm Beach.  This, of course, was 
after Epstein’s 2008 plea agreement related to his charges for solicitation of a minor in Florida.  
77.
Just months later, in November 2009, while Epstein was in jail, Staley again took 
advantage of Epstein’s hospitality—but this time at Epstein’s now-infamous private island, Little 
St. James.  While there, Staley wrote Epstein via email: “So when all hell breaks lo[o]se, and the 
world is crumbling, I will come here, and be at peace.  Presently, I’m in the hot tub with a glass of 
white wine.  This is an amazing place.  Truly amazing.  Next time, we’re here together.  I owe you 
much.  And I deeply appreciate our friendship.  I have few so profound.”31
78.
The following month, Staley made clear that he was fully aware of Epstein’s crimes 
and the risk that his ongoing relationship with Epstein posed to him.  On December 4, 2009, Staley 
seemingly met with Epstein in New York, and then wrote to him via email: “I realize the danger

24 
in sending this email.  But it was great to be able, today, to give you, in New York City, a long 
heartfelt, hug.”32
79.
The next day and later that same month, Epstein sent pictures of young women to 
Staley, to which Staley responded with cryptic commentary.  Staley again visited Little St. James 
the following month, in January 2010.  Later that year, in July, Staley had the following exchange 
with Epstein via email, strongly suggesting that Epstein was procuring victims for Staley:  
Staley: “Maybe they’re tracking u? That was fun. Say hi to Snow White.”  
Epstein: “[w]hat character would you like next?”  
Staley: “Beauty and the Beast” 
Epstein: “[W]ell one side is available.”33
80.
After the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sued JP Morgan in this Court, JP 
Morgan filed its own complaint against Staley, effectively alleging that Staley was solely 
responsible for the Bank’s longstanding relationship with Epstein, and that Staley concealed 
Epstein’s criminal activity from JP Morgan.  But the allegations detailed above, and those brought 
by Doe 1 and the U.S. Virgin Islands government, make clear that employees and senior executive 
officers across JP Morgan were fully aware of Epstein’s abusive conduct, and fully aware that 
Epstein was using his many JP Morgan accounts in a manner that was highly suspicious, if not 
obviously illegitimate.  JP Morgan’s effort to paint Staley as the sole wrongdoer is little more than 
an attempt to evade legal and reputational responsibility for knowingly failingly to report—and 
thereby enabling—Epstein’s criminal conduct for more than a decade.

V.
BY FAILING TO TAKE ACTION IN RESPONSE TO NUMEROUS RED FLAGS 
CONCERNING EPSTEIN’S CONDUCT, THE DIRECTOR DEFENDANTS 
BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES 
81.
The Board’s most fundamental responsibility is to ensure that the Company is 
operating within the law.  JP Morgan, which operates a national bank, is subject to stringent 
requirements with respect to detecting and reporting potentially criminal activity.  But instead of 
conducting effective oversight of JP Morgan’s operations, the Board sat idly by while the 
Company was used to facilitate a massive sex trafficking enterprise.  Instead of ensuring that the 
appropriate reports of suspicious activity were filed with federal authorities, for years the Board 
allowed the Bank to continue to rake in fees from Epstein’s dozens of accounts.  Even after the 
Company closed Epstein’s accounts, the Board continued to abdicate its responsibility to file 
SARs.  Finally, the Board failed to act with respect to its own executive, Staley, who knew about 
and participated in Epstein’s pernicious sex-trafficking ring. 
A.
COMPLYING WITH FEDERAL BANKING LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS MISSION 
CRITICAL FOR JP MORGAN
82.
JP Morgan and its commercial bank subsidiaries are regulated and supervised by 
numerous regulatory agencies, both domestically and internationally, including the U.S. Federal 
Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), as well as other federal 
agencies, state banking and insurance departments, and international financial services authorities. 
83.
JP Morgan acknowledges that the Company is “highly regulated” and represents in 
its Code of Conduct that legal compliance with those laws and regulations “is not just a critical 
part of our business, but fundamental to who we are.”  It advises its employees and directors that 
they must “comply with the letter, spirit, and intent of laws, regulations and Firm policies,” and 
that any violations “may weaken customer confidence, put our reputation at risk, impact market 
integrity, or result in regulator criticism, legal actions, fines or penalties, or other negative 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 25 of 53

26 
repercussions.”  JP Morgan employees and directors are prohibited from engaging in outside 
activities that “reflect adversely on JP Morgan or give rise to a real or apparent conflict of interest 
with [their] duties to the firm.”  Dimon himself has asserted that the Company has “zero tolerance” 
for improper behavior and that the bank complies with “the letter and spirit of the laws and 
regulations everywhere we do business.”34
84.
Financial institutions, like JP Morgan, are susceptible to serving as conduits for 
significant financial crimes, including money laundering.  The federal government has therefore 
established a series of clear AML laws and regulations meant to safeguard the economy by 
ensuring that banks do not engage in, or facilitate, illegitimate activities.  
85.
The primary laws governing banks with respect to AML are the Bank Secrecy Act 
of 1970 (“BSA”) and certain provisions of the USA Patriot Act.35
86.
Congress enacted the BSA to address an increase in money laundering making its 
way through financial institutions.  Together, the BSA and the Patriot Act create mandatory 
reporting and record-keeping requirements to track currency transactions and detect and prevent 
money laundering and the facilitation of other crimes.  The law requires banks to maintain 
compliance programs to prevent, identify, and report suspicious and potentially criminal activity.  
The BSA and its implementing regulations mandate that banks institute policies, procedures, and 
controls to protect against money laundering, oversee monitoring with respect to BSA 
requirements, and test their compliance programs.  Each regulated bank “must have a BSA/AML 
34 JP Morgan Code of Conduct (2022) at ii.,

27 
compliance program commensurate with its respective BSA/AML risk profile.”36  And it is the 
board of directors, “acting through senior management,” that is “ultimately responsible for 
ensuring that the bank maintains an effective BSA/AML internal control structure, including 
suspicious activity monitoring and reporting.”37  Yet policies are not enough; as explained by the 
Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Counsel—an interagency group of bank 
regulators⸺“practices must coincide with the bank’s written policies, procedures, and 
processes.”38
87.
Internal controls should (among other requirements): 

Identify banking operations . . . more vulnerable to abuse by money 
launderers and criminals; provide for periodic updates to the bank’s 
risk profile; and provide for a BSA/AML compliance program 
tailored to manage risks. 

Inform the board of directors, or a committee thereof, and senior 
management, of compliance initiatives, identified compliance 
deficiencies, and corrective action taken, and notify directors and 
senior management of [SARs] filed. 

Implement 
risk-based 
[customer 
due 
diligence] 
policies, 
procedures, and processes. 

Identify reportable transactions and accurately file all required 
reports including [SARs], Currency Transaction Reports (“CTRs”), 
and CTR exemptions . . . [and] 

Provide sufficient controls and monitoring systems for timely 
detection and reporting of suspicious activity.39

Manual”), at 28, available at https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/bsa_aml_examination_manual2006.pdf.

88.
In addition to the broad requirement for effective, meaningful internal controls, 
federal law also requires that banks promptly notify authorities upon discovering any suspicious 
activity.  These SARs are “the cornerstone of the BSA reporting system” and are “critical to the 
United States’ ability to utilize financial information to combat terrorist financing, money 
laundering, and other financial crimes.”40  The failure to timely file SARs deprives law 
enforcement of essential information it needs to combat serious crimes.   
89.
BSA’s implementing regulations, 12 CFR § 21.11 and 12 CFR § 163.180, specify 
the circumstances under which banks must file a SAR.  Section 21.11 provides that banks must 
file SARs whenever they “detect a known or suspected violation of Federal law.”41  More 
specifically, SARs are required whenever a bank: 
detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal 
violations . . . involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the bank 
and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets where the 
bank believes . . . that it was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and the bank 
has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect . . .42
Similarly, the bank must file a SAR for any transaction conducted through the bank: 
aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, if the bank knows, suspects, 
or has reason to suspect that:  . . . (ii) The transaction is designed to evade any 
regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act; or (iii) the transaction has no 
business or apparently lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular 
customer would normally be expected to engage, and the institution knows of no 
reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, 
including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.43

Notably, SARs must be submitted the finding of suspicious activity.  Banks may 
not avoid filing a SAR simply because they are not certain the activity at issue constitutes a crime.   
91.
Banks must file any SARs within 30 days “of the initial detection of facts that may 
constitute a basis for filing a SAR.”44  After filing the SAR, management must “promptly notify” 
the bank’s board or a relevant board committee.45  When the suspicious or criminal conduct is 
ongoing, banks are expected to file a new SAR every 90 days.46
B.
JP MORGAN’S BOARD IS OBLIGATED TO ENSURE AND OVERSEE A ROBUST 
AML PROGRAM
92.
JP Morgan’s directors owe fiduciary duties to the Company to conduct adequate 
oversight to ensure JP Morgan and its subsidiaries are not flouting federal laws and regulations.  
These duties include the duty to develop, implement, and enforce effective internal controls 
throughout the Company, including with respect to compliance with federal anti-money-
laundering laws and regulations.  Federal agencies that supervise the banking industry have 
repeatedly emphasized the importance of board oversight with respect to BSA/AML compliance. 
93.
JP Morgan’s primary banking subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is regulated 
by the OCC.47  OCC-regulated banks are required to “establish and implement a risk governance 
framework to manage and control the covered bank’s risk-taking activities.”48  For this purpose,

the OCC has established a set of “minimum standards,” both for the bank’s compliance systems 
and for its board of directors’ oversight.  The standards require, among other things, that the board 
of the bank establish an effective risk governance framework and “actively oversee the [] bank’s 
risk-taking activities and hold management accountable for adhering to the risk governance 
framework.”49
94.
The OCC’s Handbook on Corporate and Risk Governance explains that it is the 
bank’s board that is responsible, inter alia, for “providing effective oversight” and for confirming:  
(i)
“that the bank has a risk management system, including audit, suitable for the 
bank’s size and activities, and understanding the bank’s material risks,” 
(ii)
“that the bank has an effective system of internal controls,” and  
(iii)
“that management’s actions to correct material weaknesses, including those 
identified by the bank, its auditors and regulators, are timely and effective.”50
95.
The Handbook also provides that the bank’s board must “oversee the bank’s 
compliance management programs.”51  As such, the “OCC expects the board to be responsible for 
confirming that a system of internal controls is in place.”52  Accordingly, the board must “receive 
information about the effectiveness of the bank’s internal controls and information systems” and 
“demonstrate that it has an adequate understanding of the bank’s IT infrastructure, inherent risks,

and existing controls.”53  Significantly, the OCC’s Handbook confirms that “the sophistication of 
[a bank’s] risk management system should reflect the bank’s size, complexity, and risk profile.”54
96.
JP Morgan itself—the parent entity—is regulated by, among others, the Federal 
Reserve.  Federal Reserve regulations require, among other things, that holding companies like JP 
Morgan, which have banking subsidiaries, maintain an enterprise-wide risk management program 
that identifies and manages risk throughout the organization, and that the company’s board ensure 
that the banking subsidiaries have the proper internal controls and risk management systems in 
place: 
One of the primary areas of focus for consolidated supervision of large complex 
[bank holding companies] is the adequacy of governance provided by the board and 
senior management.  The culture, expectations, and incentives established by the 
highest levels of corporate leadership set the tone for the entire organization and 
are essential determinants of whether a banking organization is capable of 
maintaining fully effective risk management and internal control processes. 
97.
Further, Regulation YY of the Federal Reserve (12 C.F.R. § 252.33) requires the 
Board’s risk committee approve and review the bank’s risk-management policies and oversee the 
global risk-management framework.  The framework “must be commensurate with [the bank’s] 
structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size and must include”: 
(i)
Policies and procedures establishing risk-management governance, risk 
management procedures, risk-control infrastructure for its global operations; and  
(ii)
Processes and systems for implementing and monitoring compliance with such 
policies and processes, including: 
(A)
Processes and systems for identifying and reporting risks and risk-
management deficiencies, including regarding emerging risks, and 
ensuring effective and timely implementation of actions to address

emerging risks and risk-management deficiencies for its global 
operations [and]  
(B)
Processes and systems for establishing managerial and employee 
responsibility for risk management . . . 55
98.
Board oversight of those systems is imperative, according to the Federal Reserve, 
because “the board serves a critical role in maintaining the firm’s safety and soundness and 
continued financial and operational resilience of its consolidated operations.”56
99.
Two standing committees of the Board—the Risk Committee and the Audit 
Committee—impose additional oversight obligations related to the Company’s risk management 
systems, along with its internal controls.  
100.
The Risk Committee’s purpose, according to its Charter, is “to assist the Board in 
its oversight of management’s responsibility to implement an effective global risk management 
framework reasonable designed to identify, assess and manage the Firm’s strategic, credit and 
investment, market, and operational risks.”  The Risk Committee “oversees reputational risks and 
conduct risks within its scope of responsibility.”  It is required to receive and review reports from 
management concerning significant risks, set qualitative and quantitative limits for risk, and 
approve certain risk policies.  The Risk Committee is required to report periodically to the Board 
concerning any “significant matters” reviewed by the committee. 
101.
The Risk Committee is also responsible for appointing and replacing the Chief Risk 
Officer (“CRO”), and setting the Chief Risk Officer’s compensation.  The Risk Committee must 
also review the CRO’s “proposed priorities, budget and staffing plans annually.”

The Audit Committee’s purpose, in relevant part, is to “assist the Board in its 
oversight of . . . [m]anagement’s responsibilities to ensure that there is an effective system of 
controls reasonably designed to:  . . . [m]aintain compliance with the corporation’s ethical 
standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations.”  The Audit Committee 
“oversees reputational risks and conduct risks within its scope of responsibility . . .” 
103.
The Charter of the Audit Committee provides that the committee must receive from 
management—including 
the 
Risk 
and

functions—“communications 
and 
presentations,” including concerning “significant control issues” and “material weaknesses in the 
internal control environment.”  The Audit Committee must also “receive communications and 
presentations from management summarizing the suspicious activity report filing activity of the 
Firm and/or its subsidiaries with the appropriate regulatory and law enforcement agencies.” 
104.
By law, regulation, and the Company’s own policies, directors had a non-delegable 
obligation to conduct sufficient, effective oversight to ensure that the bank was operating in 
compliance with the law.  Instead, the Board ignored a series of glaringly obvious indications that 
Jeffrey Epstein used the bank for years to facilitate a sex trafficking operation and to abuse young 
women and girls. 
C.
THE DIRECTORS FAILED TO RESPOND TO BRIGHT RED FLAGS CONCERNING 
EPSTEIN’S USE OF THE BANK’S SERVICES TO CONDUCT A CRIMINAL 
ENTERPRISE
105.
Despite the clear obligations of the Company’s Board—set forth in federal 
regulation and in the Company’s own policies and committee charters⸺to ensure that JP Morgan 
was conducting its business in compliance with the law, for years the Board sat on its hands as the 
Bank continued to provide services to disgraced sexual offender Epstein.   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 33 of 53

34 
106.
Since 2006, the directors serving on the Board had knowledge that Epstein was a 
serial abuser of young women and girls.  Even so, the Bank declined to turned him away, choosing 
instead to rake in fees year after year from servicing the accounts through which he operated the 
most notorious sex trafficking ring in recent history.  The Board also failed to ensure that the 
Company was meeting its obligations under federal anti-money-laundering laws.  Upon 
information and belief, at no point from 2006 onward did JP Morgan submit any SARs concerning 
Epstein, despite the mounds of evidence available to the Bank that Epstein was using his cash to 
fund a criminal enterprise and that he was often attempting to structure his transactions to avoid 
government oversight. 
107.
As discussed above, from 1998 to 2013, the Company serviced more than 4 dozen 
accounts for Epstein worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which he used to facilitate his sexual 
abuse of young girls and women.  
108.
The Board knew about Epstein’s predation no later than 2006.  That year, Epstein 
was arrested and indicted for solicitation of a minor, and the press extensively reported about his 
abuse of that, and other, victims.  The Company’s Global Corporate Security Division flagged 
these press reports, but JP Morgan maintained Epstein’s account, despite concluding that it should 
be “classified as high risk” and require special approval. 
109.
Mary Erdoes, a high-level executive at the Company, admitted in a deposition that 
the Company knew in 2006 that Epstein abused young girls and paid them in cash.  At the same 
time, JP Morgan employees were reporting that Epstein was withdrawing $80,000 at a time 
multiple times a month.  The Bank was also aware that Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008, was 
sentenced to serve 18 months in jail, and registered as a sex offender. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 34 of 53

35 
110.
Despite being aware of Epstein’s arrest and guilty plea, and press reports 
concerning his pedophilia, sexual abuse, and engagement in prostitution, the Bank continued to 
provide Epstein with banking services for seven more years following his arrest, facilitating his 
criminal trafficking enterprise.  The Bank continued doing business with the disgraced, but 
wealthy, Epstein, even after Defendant Dimon’s purported review of Epstein’s account. 
111.
As discussed further above, revelations continued even after Epstein’s guilty plea.  
In 2011, the Company was made aware of more allegations of human trafficking involving 
Epstein.  But while employees discussed “the situation,” they did little more than encourage 
Staley—Epstein’s buddy and co-conspirator—to “discuss” the allegations with him.  When 
Epstein denied the allegations, the Bank continued to do business with him.  Later in 2011, the 
Bank was aware of reports that law enforcement was investigating Epstein for participating in 
trafficking and molestation of children and that Epstein had settled “a dozen” claims regarding 
solicitation.  Even a senior compliance official warned that there were “[l]ots of questions” 
concerning Epstein’s behavior.  But the Bank refused to cut Epstein off until 2013. 
112.
The Board was no doubt aware of the mountain of press reports concerning 
Epstein’s conduct, particularly following his very public arrest in 2006.  Yet the Board did not take 
action to terminate the accounts of the ultrawealthy Epstein or cause management to file timely 
SARs.  In failing to ensure that the Bank ceased doing business with the sexual predator, the 
directors engaged in bad faith, risking liability for the Company and causing untold reputational 
harm.   
113.
The obligation to file SARs concerning Epstein’s conduct did not cease when the 
Company finally, and belatedly, terminated Epstein’s account in 2013.  Yet it appears that the 
Bank continued to fail to submit such reports to authorities from 2013 until at least 2019.  Directors

on the Board during this period continued to be responsible for ensuring that the Bank met its legal 
obligations, including the obligation to file reports concerning the criminal activity in which 
Epstein engaged while he maintained a banking relationship with JP Morgan.  By failing to ensure 
that the Bank complied with federal laws concerning suspicious transactions and transactions 
potentially implicating criminal activity, Defendants acted in bad faith and breached their fiduciary 
duties to the Company.57
D.
THE COMPANY HAD A TROUBLING HISTORY OF FAILING TO COMPLY WITH 
BSA/AML REGULATIONS AND THE BOARD SHOULD HAVE EXERCISED 
HEIGHTENED DILIGENCE
114.
Furthermore, no later than January 2013, the Board was fully aware of weaknesses 
in JP Morgan’s AML program and should have exercised heightened diligence conducting 
oversight.  On January 14, 2013, the Company’s main banking subsidiary, JP Morgan Chase, N.A., 
entered into a consent order with the OCC (the “2013 OCC Consent Order”) because the regulator 
had “identified deficiencies in the Bank’s overall program for Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money 
Laundering (‘BSA/AML’) compliance . . . ”  More specifically, JP Morgan had failed to correct a 
previously identified problem and BSA/AML compliance violation, and had also violated 
regulations concerning suspicious activity reports. 
115.
According to the OCC, “[t]he Bank has failed to adopt and implement a compliance 
program that adequately covers the required BSA/AML program elements due to an inadequate 
57 Indeed, it was just this type of failure with respect to Epstein—i.e., a failure to investigate 
Epstein’s banking activities and to report Epstein’s suspicious transactions—that led Deutsche 
Bank to being hit with a $150 million penalty by the N.Y. State Department of Financial Services.  
The regulator noted that the fact that Epstein’s cash withdraws “were suspicious should have been 
obvious to Bank personnel at various levels.  [Deutsche Bank’s] failure to recognize this risk 
constitutes a major compliance failure.” 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 36 of 53

37 
system of internal controls, and ineffective independent testing.”  Notably, the bank58 had failed 
to “develop adequate due diligence on customers, particularly in the Commercial and Business 
Banking Unit, a repeat problem, and failed to file all necessary Suspicious Activity Reports 
(‘SARs’) related to suspicious customer activity.”  The bank had also failed to remedy weaknesses 
in “the effectiveness of monitoring in light of the customers’ cash activity and business type…” 
116.
According to the OCC, JP Morgan had “an inadequate system of internal controls 
and independent testing, “systemic deficiencies in its transaction monitoring systems [and] due 
diligence processes . . .”  The regulator also noted that the bank had “significant shortcomings in 
SAR decision-making protocols and an ineffective method for ensuring that referrals and alerts are 
properly documented, tracked, and resolved.”  In violation of federal regulations, the bank “failed 
to identify significant volumes of suspicious activity and filed the required SARs concerning 
suspicious customer activities . . .”  As a result of the 2013 OCC Consent Order, the bank was 
required to take a series of remedial steps, including evaluating its systems for monitoring 
transactions and filing suspicious activity reports.  It was also required to refresh its risk 
assessments, at least every year.  In addition, the bank was required to conduct a SAR look-back 
to determine “whether additional SARs should be filed on additional subjects or for continuing 
suspicious activity.” 
117.
The 2013 OCC Consent Order was approved by the bank’s board and executed by 
both Defendants Crown and Dimon, on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
118.
Just as the OCC had done with respect to the Company’s banking subsidiary, 
JPMorgan Case, N.A., the Federal Reserve issued a Consent Order against the Company itself in 
58 Because the OCC orders discussed in this section deal specifically with JP Morgan Chase, N.A., 
references to the “bank” in this section are to this subsidiary, rather than to the parent entity, JP 
Morgan (as defined above). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 37 of 53

38 
January 2013 (the “2013 Federal Reserve Order”).  The 2013 Federal Reserve Order required the 
Board to submit a plan to improve the Company’s “firmwide compliance risk management 
program with regard to compliance with BSA/AML Requirements.”  In the plan, the Board was 
required to address funding for a sufficient compliance program, policies to ensure risks are timely 
identified and managed, and measures to improve the Company’s policies, procedures and 
standards.  The Company was also required to review and address the “policies, procedures, and 
processes” for “identifying and investigating suspicious activity, and for filing suspicious activity 
reports” and “customer due diligence that consolidates information” on each customer. 
119.
Because JP Morgan’s BSA/AML systems continued to be deficient, in January 
2014 the OCC issued a Consent Order of the Assessment of a Civil Money Penalty (the “2014 
OCC Penalty Order”).  The 2014 OCC Penalty Order indicated that the regulator had discovered 
“additional deficiencies in the Bank’s BSA/AML compliance program.”  In particular, the OCC 
determined that the bank continued to fail to remedy previously identified problems with its 
BSA/AML compliance program and continued to violate regulations concerning SARs. 
120.
The OCC determined that, as in 2013, the bank’s BSA/AML program remained 
deficient and the Bank had failed to “develop adequate due diligence on customers” and to “file 
all necessary SARs related to suspicious customer activity.”  The bank “failed to correct previously 
identified systemic weaknesses” concerning customer due diligence and transaction monitoring.  
More specifically, the bank continued to have “significant shortcomings in SAR decision-making 
protocols and an ineffective method for ensuring that referrals and alerts [were] properly 
documented, tracked, and resolved,” and “failed to identify significant volumes of suspicious 
activity and file the required SARs . . .”  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 38 of 53

39 
121.
As a result of these failures, the OCC ordered JP Morgan to pay $350 million in a 
civil money penalty.   
122.
The 2014 Penalty Order was approved by the bank’s board and was executed by 
Defendants Crown, Jackson, and Weldon.   
123.
On January 7, 2014, the bank entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the 
“DPA”) with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  In the DPA, the 
bank admitted that it had failed to file SARs concerning the activities of another extraordinarily 
wealthy banking client, Bernie Madoff.  In the DPA, the bank pleaded guilty to two felony counts 
of failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and failing to file a suspicious 
activity report. 
124.
The 2013 OCC Consent Order remained in effect until May 2019, and the 2013 
Federal Reserve order remained in effect until December 2019. 
125.
Because the bank had pleaded guilty to two felonies and paid $350 million in 
penalties relating to its failures to file suspicious activity reports and other BSA/AML deficiencies, 
the Board was no doubt aware that the Company’s risk management systems—particularly with 
respect to SARs—required additional oversight and diligence.  Even so, in the years following the 
consent orders, upon information and belief, the Company continued to fail to file SAR reports 
concerning the transactions Epstein had conducted with the bank while his account was open. 
E.
THE BOARD FAILED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST STALEY
126.
The Board also failed to pursue claims against Staley until March 8, 2023.  Staley 
was the CEO of JP Morgan’s Asset Management line of business from 2001 to 2009, and then 
became the CEO of the Corporate and Investment Banking line of business in 2009 until he left 
the Company in 2013. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 39 of 53

40 
127.
The evidence of Staley’s involvement with Epstein was clear.  See ¶¶74-80, supra.  
Staley was close friends with Epstein and knew about his sexual predation of young women and 
girls.  According to Doe, Staley “personally observed Doe as a sex trafficking and abuse victim at 
times including through his departure from JP Morgan in 2013.”59  He also met with young girls 
while visiting with Epstein.  Staley is also credibly accused of using “aggressive force in his sexual 
assault” of plaintiff Doe.60
128.
Despite the clear evidence of Staley advocating on behalf of Epstein to maintain 
his Company accounts, despite having access to over 1,200 emails sent from Staley’s JP Morgan 
company account to Epstein which raised questions about Staley’s possible involvement in 
Epstein’s criminal enterprise, and despite press reports making clear the close relationship between 
Epstein and Staley, the Director Defendants failed to pursue claims against Staley until March 
2023.  At that time, the Company filed claims against him, including for breaching his fiduciary 
duty and violating the “faithless servant doctrine.”  By failing to act in a timely fashion, the Board 
has risked the viability of the claim by subjecting it to a potential statute of limitations defense.  
Indeed, in his April 24, 2023 Motion to Dismiss in the lawsuit JP Morgan belatedly brought against 
Staley, Staley has argued that those claims are time-barred.61
VI.
THE OFFICER DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES 
129.
Officers of Delaware corporations, like directors, have fiduciary duties to the 
companies, including the duties of good faith and due care.  Officers’ duty of good faith includes

41 
an obligation to conduct adequate oversight.  Officers are required to “make a good faith effort to 
ensure that information systems are in place” so that “officers receive relevant and timely 
information that they can provide to the directors.”62  Officers must also act on red flags of which 
they are aware, as they are “optimally positioned to identify red flags and either address them or 
report upward to more senior officers or to the board.”63
130.
Officers of banking entities have specific obligations when it comes to protecting 
the companies from risk, including BSA/AML risk. The OCC’s Comptroller’s Handbook explains 
that the “OCC expects senior management to be responsible for developing and maintaining the 
risk governance framework and system of internal controls, which enables management to 
effectively identify, measure, monitor, control, and report risk exposures consistent with the board-
established risk appetite.”64  Moreover, the “CEO and his or her senior management team should 
be responsible for,” among other things, “complying with laws, regulations, and internal bank 
policies, including policies governing ethics and insider activities,” developing and administering 
a risk governance framework that enables management to effectively identify, measure, monitor, 
and control risk,” and “establishing and maintaining an effective system of internal controls.” 
131.
JP Morgan’s policies spell out in particular the obligations of the Chief Risk Officer 
(“CRO”) of the Company.  The CRO is required to attend meetings of the Board’s Risk Committee 
and to discuss with the committee “any concerns that they reasonably believe could be material to 
the Firm or to a line of business,” including any “actions that have been or are planned to be taken

to address such concerns.”  Between meetings, the CRO must “promptly report” any such issues 
to the Risk Committee’s Chair.  The CRO also has full access to communications with and report 
to the Audit Committee “on any matter relevant to risk and compliance.” 
132.
Despite their obligations under federal banking laws and regulations, and the 
Company’s own policies, the Officer Defendants failed to fulfill their fiduciary obligations of due 
care and oversight.  Like the Director Defendants, the Officer Defendants ignored the glaring red 
flags concerning the Company’s complicity in a criminal sex trafficking scheme, including 
repeated news reports concerning Epstein’s involvement in the abuse of girls and young women.   
133.
The Officer Defendants—including Defendants Bacon, Hogan, and Zubrow (JP 
Morgan’s CROs)—failed to ensure that the Company was following the law and its own policies 
with respect to the AML compliance.  According to an investigation by the U.S. Virgin Islands 
government, “it does not appear . . . that JP Morgan engaged in any investigation of the source of 
Epstein’s funds.”65  Likewise, the Company also “seemingly did no due diligence on the nature of 
the various business entities for which it held accounts for Epstein, which appear to have no 
legitimate business purpose and, upon information and belief, were part of Epstein’s criminal 
enterprise in the Virgin Islands.”66
134.
The Officer Defendants also failed to ensure that SARs were timely filed 
concerning Epstein’s banking activities.  A convicted felon and sex offender was able to continue 
withdraw tens of thousands of dollars in cash every month from the Bank for years, using those 
funds to abuse young women and girls.  When Company employees finally did start to raise 
alarms—given repeated press reports about Epstein’s activities—management did nothing.

43 
Internal discussions resulted in nothing more than Staley—Epstein’s buddy—feeling Epstein out 
and reporting back to other employees that all was well.  And a review of Epstein’s account that 
was to be conducted by CEO Dimon either never took place or, if it did, Dimon must have 
sanctioned the bank’s relationship with Epstein, as it was not until 2013—some seven years after 
Epstein was arrested—that the Bank closed his accounts.  Because of the Officer Defendants’ 
failure to act in good faith and with due care, the bank thus helped Epstein prey on vulnerable girls 
for almost a decade.

138.
Plaintiff will adequately and fairly represent the interests of the Company and its 
stockholders in this litigation and has retained counsel competent and experienced in stockholder 
derivative actions. 
139.
The wrongful acts complained of herein subject, and will persist in subjecting, the 
Company to continuing harm because the adverse consequences of the injurious actions are still 
in effect and ongoing.

140.
Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation above as if set forth in full 
herein. 
141.
Plaintiff has not made a demand on the Board to pursue the claims set forth herein 
because any pre-suit demand would be futile and is therefore excused as a matter of law. 
142.
The Demand Board consists of twelve directors: Defendants Dimon, Bammann, 
Burke, Combs, Crown, Flynn, Hobson, and Neal, as well as non-Defendants Davis, Gorsky, 
Novakovic, and Rometty.   
143.
A demand on the current Board would be futile because eight of the Demand Board 
Members⸺Defendants Dimon, Bammann, Burke, Combs, Crown, Flynn, Hobson, and 
Neal⸺face a substantial risk of liability for acting in bad faith by knowingly or recklessly 
permitting the Company to continue to serve as a banker for Epstein’s criminal enterprise and for 
failing to ensure that JP Morgan operated in compliance with federal law and Company policy 
concerning the timely filing of SARs.   
144.
Each of the Defendant Demand Board members either served on the Board during 
the time that Epstein maintained his accounts at JP Morgan used them to conduct his sex trafficking 
scheme (i.e., Defendants Dimon, Burke, Crown, and Flynn) and/or served on the Board during the 
time in which JP Morgan was obligated, but failed, to submit SARs regarding Epstein’s 
transactions with the bank (i.e., Defendants Dimon, Burke, Combs, Crown, Flynn, Hobson, and 
Neal). 
145.
Defendants on the Board at the time of the OCC orders face additional risk because 
they were not only aware of Epstein’s conduct, but they were also serving at the time the Company 
was sanctioned because of its history of failing to comply with AML rules, including rules 
concerning SARs.  Defendants Dimon, Bammann, Burke, Crown, and Flynn were each on the 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 44 of 53

45 
Board at the time one or more of the regulators’ orders were issued.  Moreover, Defendants Dimon 
and Crown both executed the 2013 OCC Consent Order, which established that the Company had 
deficiencies in its BSA/AML compliance program in violation of federal law and regulations.  
Despite being fully cognizant of the weakness in the Company’s AML program, Defendants failed 
to act to ensure that timely reports were filed concerning Epstein’s conduct. 
146.
Defendant Dimon, in particular, faces a substantial risk of liability.  He has been 
the Company’s CEO since 2006 and Chairman since 2007, even before Epstein was arrested.  He 
also either failed to review the Epstein accounts over which Company employees had raised 
concerns or, having reviewed them, failed to act to close the predator off from his funds.  He also 
failed to ensure that his management team effectively supervised the Company’s BSA/AML 
compliance system. 
147.
Defendant Bammann also has an increased risk of liability as she, in particular, 
should have been alert to federal requirements concerning an effective BSA/AML program and to 
the Company’s deficiencies in meeting those standards.  When public reports emerged about 
Epstein’s criminal conduct, Bammann should have taken action to ascertain the Company’s 
involvement with Epstein, close his accounts, and file timely SARs.  After all, before joining the 
Board, and during the time that Epstein maintained his accounts at the bank, Bammann served as 
Deputy Head of Risk Management for JP Morgan Chase, N.A., and before that, as Chief Risk 
Management Officer at Bank One.  Indeed, in encouraging shareholders to support her Board 
nomination, the Company touted her “extensive expertise in risk management and regulatory 
issues.”67

46 
148.
Thus, any lawsuit initiated to remedy the wrongs complained of herein would 
expose at least eight of the twelve current Board members to significant personal liability for their 
bad faith breaches of fiduciary duties and other misconduct. 
149.
The Demand Board members also suffer from a lack of independence from 
Defendant Dimon.  The Demand Board directors have demonstrated their lack of independence by 
choosing to pursue its belated claims only against Staley, choosing to pin all of the Defendants’ 
failures on him and to avoid implicating Dimon in JP Morgan’s misconduct concerning Epstein.  
In contrast, an independent Board would have promptly pursued claims against all of those 
individuals—including directors and former directors—who failed to implement and oversee an 
effective BSA/AML system and ignored waving red flags.  Rather that aggressively pursuing 
claims against all involved officers, the Demand Board “circled the wagons” by seeking to tag 
only an executive that conveniently no longer works for JP Morgan. 
150.
In addition, Defendant Bammann is conflicted because she is a former Company 
executive and worked closely with and for Defendant Dimon.  She served under, and reported to, 
Defendant Dimon at Bank One from 2000-2004, where he publicly praised her contributions; she 
followed Dimon to the Company when it acquired Bank One, and worked for him until the end of 
2005, later returning to the Company to join the Board in 2013.  As a spokesman for institutional 
investor CtW Investment Group noted, Bammann was too close to Dimon, and “[b]ringing in 
someone who is a former deputy of Jamie Dimon’s is absolutely the wrong move.”  With her close 
ties to the man under whom she served for half a decade, Bammann could not reasonably be 
expected to pursue litigation against Defendant Dimon.   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 46 of 53

47 
151.
For the foregoing reasons, at least eight of the twelve members of the Demand 
Board are incapable of impartially considering a litigation demand against the Defendants, and 
demand is therefore excused as futile.  
CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
COUNT I
Breach Of Fiduciary Duty 
(Against The Director Defendants) 
152.
Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation above as if set forth in full 
herein. 
153.
The Director Defendants, as current and former directors of JP Morgan, all owed 
and owe and owe fiduciary duties to JP Morgan and its stockholders.  By reason of their fiduciary 
relationships, the Director Defendants specifically owed and owe JP Morgan the highest obligation 
of good faith and loyalty in the administration of the affairs of the Company, including, without 
limitation, the oversight of JP Morgan’s compliance with the BSA and regulations promulgated 
thereunder, and laws and regulations governing AML requirements.  
154.
In addition, the Director Defendants owed and owe specific fiduciary duties as 
defined by the Company’s corporate governance documents, including the charters of various 
Board committees (including, but not limited to, those of the Audit and Risk Policy Committees) 
that, had they been discharged in accordance with the Director Defendants’ obligations, would 
have necessarily prevented the misconduct and the consequent harm to the Company alleged 
herein.  
155.
The Director Defendants consciously breached their fiduciary duties and violated 
their corporate responsibilities by affirmatively and repeatedly ignoring red flags related to 
Epstein’s criminal activity and Epstein’s criminal use of his accounts and funds at JP Morgan.  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 47 of 53

48

As a direct and proximate result of the Director Defendants’ conscious failure to 
perform their fiduciary duties and exercise their oversight responsibility, JP Morgan has sustained, 
and will continue to sustain, significant damages—both financially and to its corporate image and 
goodwill.  Such damages to JP Morgan caused by the Director Defendants include and will include, 
substantial penalties, fines, damages awards, settlements, expenses, increased regulatory scrutiny, 
reputational harm, and other liabilities described herein.   
157.

herein. 
159.

owe fiduciary duties to JP Morgan and its stockholders.  By reason of their fiduciary relationships, 
the Officer Defendants specifically owed and owe JP Morgan the highest obligation of good faith 
and loyalty in the administration of the affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, the 
oversight of JP Morgan’s compliance with the BSA and regulations promulgated thereunder, and 
laws and regulations governing AML requirements.  
160.
In addition, the Officer Defendants owed and owe specific fiduciary duties as 
defined by the Company’s corporate governance documents that, had they been discharged in 
accordance with the Officer Defendants’ obligations, would have necessarily prevented the 
misconduct and the consequent harm to the Company alleged herein.  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 48 of 53

their corporate responsibilities by affirmatively and repeatedly ignoring red flags related to 
Epstein’s criminal activity and Epstein’s criminal use of his accounts and funds at JP Morgan.

perform their fiduciary duties and exercise their oversight responsibility, JP Morgan has sustained, 
and will continue to sustain, significant damages—both financially and to its corporate image and 
goodwill.  Such damages to JP Morgan caused by the Officer Defendants include and will include, 
substantial penalties, fines, damages awards, settlements, expenses, increased regulatory scrutiny, 
reputational harm, and other liabilities described herein.

(Against The Officer Defendants) 
164.
Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation above as if set forth in full 
herein. 
165.
The Officer Defendants, as current and former officers of JP Morgan, all owed and 
owe fiduciary duties to JP Morgan and its stockholders.  By reason of their fiduciary relationships, 
the Officer Defendants specifically owed and owe JP Morgan the highest obligation of due care in 
the administration of the affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, ensuring JP 
Morgan’s compliance with the BSA and regulations promulgated thereunder, and laws and 
regulations governing AML requirements.  
166.
In addition, the Officer Defendants owed and owe specific fiduciary duties as 
defined by the Company’s corporate governance documents that, had they been discharged in 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 49 of 53

50 
accordance with the Officer Defendants’ obligations, would have necessarily prevented the 
misconduct and the consequent harm to the Company alleged herein.  
167.

their corporate responsibilities by consistently and repeatedly permitting JP Morgan to breach or 
fail to comply with its legal and regulatory reporting and compliance requirements related to 
Epstein’s criminal activity and Epstein’s criminal use of his accounts and funds at JP Morgan.  
168.

described herein.
