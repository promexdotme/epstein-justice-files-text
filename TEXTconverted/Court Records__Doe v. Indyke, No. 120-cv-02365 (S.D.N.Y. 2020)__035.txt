Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”)1, respectfully submit this Statement On Plaintiff Jane Doe’s 
(“Plaintiff”) Application to Proceed Anonymously (ECF No. 31) (the “Application”). 
I.
The Co-Executors Have Never Opposed The Right Of Alleged Victims To Maintain 
Anonymity And Do Not Do So Here. 
The Co-Executors have never sought to prevent any alleged victim of Mr. Epstein from 
proceeding anonymously; they do not do so here. To the contrary, after Mr. Epstein’s death, the 
Co-Executors established and funded in its entirety the independently administered Epstein 
Victims’ Compensation Program, which gave Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims the opportunity to 
resolve their claims in complete confidence if they so desired.2 The Program ultimately awarded 
nearly $125 million to approximately 150 eligible claimants.3
Nevertheless, in this unique situation, the Co-Executors have determined that it is 
appropriate to bring to the Court’s attention material facts not contained in Plaintiff’s Application, 
so that the Court can rule on it with the benefit of all relevant information, as follows: (1) Plaintiff 
 (2) Plaintiff has, 
 
 and (3) Plaintiff has

Support of Plaintiff’s Application to Proceed Anonymously (ECF No. 31), and the Declaration of Daniel J. Kaiser 
(ECF No. 30) list more than two dozen defendants who are not parties to this action. Plaintiff’s Complaint (ECF No. 
1), which has not been amended, was brought only against Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities 
as executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. Accordingly, this Statement is filed on behalf of the Co-Executors 
only. 
2 No claimant who participated in the Program is bound by any rules of confidentiality—to the contrary, they are free 
to tell their stories publicly.

As Plaintiff explains in her Application, when determining whether to permit a party to 
proceed under a pseudonym, the Second Circuit considers at least ten non-exhaustive factors 
pursuant to Sealed Plaintiff. Doe v. Zinsou, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131520, at *7-8 (S.D.N.Y. 
Aug. 6, 2019) (Ramos, J.) (citing Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 188-89 (2d 
Cir. 2008)). Relevant to this discussion are the factors related to Plaintiff’s identity.

 Accordingly, it is subject to judicial notice. See, e.g., Sharette v. Credit Suisse Int’l, 127 F. 
Supp. 3d 60, 75 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (“[A] court may take judicial notice of ‘a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute 
because it . . . can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be 
questioned.’” (citing Island Software & Computer Serv., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 413 F.3d 257, 261 (2d Cir. 2005)

Conclusion 
While the Co-Executors take no position on Plaintiff’s Application to Proceed 
Anonymously, they believe the Court should decide it with the benefit of all relevant information.
