Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Estate”), Nine East 71st Street, Corporation, Financial Trust Company, 
Inc., NES, LLC, Florida Science Foundation, Inc., HBRK Associates, Inc., JEGE, Inc., Maple, 
Inc., and LSJ, LLC (together, “Defendants”; and Defendants together with Plaintiffs VE, Katlyn 
Doe, Priscilla Doe, Lisa Doe and Anastasia Doe, the “Parties”) in the referenced actions, as 
applicable.  We write on behalf of all Parties to report to the Court regarding settlement and to 
respectfully request that the Court approve the Parties’ discovery proposal.  
We understand that the vast majority of the plaintiffs in the above referenced and other actions 
against the Estate pending in this District will or are very likely to participate in the Epstein 
Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”), with five plaintiffs having already voluntarily 
stayed their actions pending their participation in the Program.  Counsel for all such plaintiffs 
have conferred extensively with the Program designers and administrator, including in person, 
to, among other things, provide specific input on the draft Program protocol issued on 
December 13, 2019.  We understand such discussions have been positive and productive. 
The Parties propose the following schedule for discovery:  Plaintiffs and the Estate will make 
initial disclosures by January 23, 2020; the Parties will exchange proposed discovery plans by 
January 30, 2020; and the Parties will jointly submit to Your Honor a proposed discovery plan by 
February 6, 2020.
