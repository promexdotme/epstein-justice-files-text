Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), respectfully submit this Memorandum of Law in support of their 
Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Jane Doe’s (“Plaintiff”) Complaint (ECF No. 1) pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
Plaintiff brings a single count against the Co-Executors for Jeffrey Epstein’s (“Epstein”) 
alleged violations of Sections 1591, 1593A, 1594(a), and 1594(b) of the Trafficking Victims 
Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, et seq. (“TVPA”). (Compl. ¶¶ 33, 36.) The Court must dismiss 
that claim for two separate reasons. 
First, Plaintiff’s claim must be dismissed because she fails to plead its essential elements. 
Plaintiff does not sufficiently allege Epstein’s knowledge or how Doe was coerced under § 1591, 
a financial benefit under § 1593A, or an agreement or meeting of the minds under § 1594(b). And 
because she fails to adequately state a claim under § 1591, her claim for attempt under § 1594(a) 
necessarily fails as well. 
Second, as the Court (Hon. Edgardo Ramos) found in another lawsuit against the Co-
Executors, because the TVPA provides for a ten-year statute of limitations period for adult victims, 
any claim based on conduct occurring more than ten years before filing of the complaint must be 
dismissed with prejudice as untimely. Lisa Doe v. Indyke, 465 F. Supp. 3d 452, 462 (S.D.N.Y. 
2020). Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiff’s claim is based on alleged conduct occurring before 
March 17, 2010, the Court must dismiss it as time-barred. 
Separately, and also consistent with Judge Ramos’s decision in Lisa Doe, the Court must 
dismiss Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages because “punitive damages under the TVPA are 
not available after a defendant has died.” Id. at 471 (dismissing with prejudice plaintiff’s claim for 
punitive damages under the TVPA).

STATEMENT OF ALLEGED FACTS 
Plaintiff’s allegations, which are assumed to be true solely for purposes of this Motion, are 
insufficient to put the Co-Executors on notice of what she alleges happened to her that constituted 
TVPA violations. Except for a single paragraph concerning one occurrence in 2012—which 
allegation has no alleged nexus to any coercion or commercial sex acts—Plaintiff does not 
articulate (beyond mere conclusions and vague allegations) what specifically happened to her, 
what Epstein knew and when, or when the abuse ended. Instead, Plaintiff merely asserts labels and 
conclusions in an apparent attempt to check off the elements of the asserted TVPA violations.   
Plaintiff vaguely alleges she was a 22-year-old adult when Epstein began abusing her 
“nearly 19 years [ago].” (Compl. ¶¶ 2-3.) She further alleges she was “paid in part to be sexually 
available to Epstein” (id. ¶ 27), and that he sexually abused and exerted “continuous psychological 
and physical control” over her “on a relatively consistent basis for many years” (id. ¶ 20). She 
alleges this abuse occurred in New York, Florida, New Mexico, the U.K., France, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, as well as on private jets. (Id. ¶ 26.)  
In sum, Plaintiff asserts a single, jumbled cause of action for alleged violations of Sections 
1591, 1594(a), 1594(b), and 1594A of the TVPA. She also requests general damages, attorneys’ 
fees, and punitive damages. (Id. ¶¶ 29-37.) 
LEGAL STANDARDS 
“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, 
accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 
662, 678 (2009). While the Court must normally accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations 
in a complaint and draw all inferences in a plaintiff’s favor, those principles are “inapplicable to 
legal conclusions.” Id. at 678 (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 556 (2007)).

Thus, a pleading that offers only “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of the elements 
of a cause of action” will not do. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. 
ARGUMENT 
I.
Plaintiff’s TVPA Claim Is Insufficiently Pleaded And Must Be Dismissed 
a. Plaintiff’s Section 1591 claim fails to sufficiently allege knowledge, means of 
force, threats of force, fraud or coercion; and, accordingly, her Section 1594(a) 
claim for attempt to violate Section 1591 also fails.
Plaintiff fails to allege necessary elements of a TVPA § 1591 claim. To plead a TVPA § 
1591 cause of action, Plaintiff is required to allege beyond mere labels and conclusions that 
Epstein: 
knowingly— 
(1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and 
territorial jurisdiction of the United States, recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, 
obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means a person; or 
(2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture 
which has engaged in an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, or, except 
where the act constituting the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless 
disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion described in 
subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be used to cause the person to 
engage in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not attained the age of 18 years and 
will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as provided in 
subsection (b). 
18 U.S.C. §1591(a). However, Plaintiff has not asserted any allegations of knowledge, force, 
threats of force, fraud or coercion except in purely conclusory fashion. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 29 
(“Defendant, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, in 
interstate and foreign commerce, and/or affecting interstate and foreign commerce, knowingly 
recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, maintained, patronized, solicited, 
threatened, forced, or coerced Plaintiff to engage in commercial sex acts.”)). Under Twombly and 
Iqbal, this is insufficient to state a claim.

119125600
Plaintiff’s sole specific allegation is that, sometime in 2012, Epstein “grabbed [her] by the 
hand” and performed a sex act on her. (Id. ¶ 28.) This allegation does not by itself remedy 
Plaintiff’s otherwise deficient allegations. Plaintiff does not even attempt to articulate how the 
single alleged occurrence in 2012 is related to the asserted TVPA violations—it is just a transparent 
attempt to allege an occurrence within the statute of limitations. 
Accordingly, the Court must dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for violations of TVPA § 1591.  
Plaintiff’s claim under TVPA § 1594(a)—that Epstein attempted to violate § 1591—necessarily 
fails as a result and the Court must dismiss it as well. See, e.g., Stein v. World-Wide Plumbing 
Supply Inc., 71 F. Supp. 3d 320, 330 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (dismissing claim for attempted violation 
of the TVPA against certain defendants because plaintiff failed to adequately plead an underlying 
violation of the TVPA against those defendants). 
b. Plaintiff’s conspiracy claim under Section 1591(b) fails to sufficiently allege 
the necessary element of an agreement.
Plaintiff’s allegations that Epstein was involved in a conspiracy to violate the TVPA 
(Compl. ¶ 32) are insufficient to state a claim because (i) she fails to sufficiently allege the 
necessary element of an agreement, and (ii) her conspiracy allegations consist of nothing more 
than “labels and conclusions.” See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. 
The entirety of Plaintiff’s conspiracy allegations is found in two conclusory paragraphs:  
13.  
At all times relevant herein, Jeffrey Epstein [“Epstein”] was an extremely 
wealthy financier, who used his wealth, power, resources, and connections to 
commit illegal sexual crimes in violation of the TVPRA [sic], and to employ and 
conspire with other corporate entities, private foundations and trusts, to assist him 
in committing those sexual crimes or torts or to facilitate or enable those acts to 
occur.

32.  
Defendant1 conspired with each member of the enterprise, and with other 
persons known and unknown, to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In so doing, Defendant 
violated U.S.C. § 1594(a).2
Fatal to her claim, Plaintiff does not plead an agreement or meeting of the minds between or among 
Epstein and anyone else. See Chen Gang v. Zhao Zhizhen, 799 F. App’x 16, 19 (2d Cir. 2020) (“To 
maintain a civil conspiracy action, the plaintiff must provide some factual basis supporting a 
meeting of the minds, such that defendants entered into an agreement, express or tacit, to achieve 
the unlawful end.”) (affirming District Court’s dismissal of conspiracy claims for failing to meet 
Twombly standards); Webb v. Goord, 340 F.3d 105, 111 (2d Cir. 2003) (“The plaintiffs have not 
alleged, except in the most conclusory fashion, that any such meeting of the minds occurred among 
any or all of the defendants. Their conspiracy allegation must therefore fail.”). 
While Plaintiff’s allegation implies the existence of an “enterprise,” she does not describe 
or define the so-called “enterprise,” nor otherwise identify (beyond broad categories) any alleged 
co-conspirators, how they were involved in the conspiracy, how or when they had a meeting of the 
minds, how the conspiracy worked, or how the conspiracy was connected to or harmed Plaintiff. 
Vaguely alleging a conspiracy, without any allegation of an agreement or meeting of the minds, is 
insufficient to articulate the conspiracy on which the alleged Section 1594(b) violations are based. 
Accordingly, the Court must dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for violations of TVPA § 1594(b). 
c.
Plaintiff’s TVPA Section 1593A Claim Contains No Supporting Allegations 
And Must Be Dismissed  
Plaintiff’s claim for violations of TVPA § 1593A must be dismissed because she fails to 
assert any supporting facts. Section 1593A provides for liability for those who “knowingly 
1 Because Plaintiff names as defendants Messrs. Indyke and Kahn solely in their capacities as Co-Executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, and not in their personal capacities, and because all allegations of sexual abuse allege it 
was committed by Epstein, the Co-Executors presume that “Defendant” refers to Epstein. 
2 While this paragraph alleges a conspiracy, which, according to Plaintiff, amounted to a violation of “§ 1594(a),” it 
is § 1594(b) that proscribes conspiracies to violate the TVPA, not § 1594(a).

119125600
benefit[], financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has 
engaged in any act in violation of [the TVPA].” 18 U.S.C. § 1593A. Plaintiff references Section 
1593A only twice in her Complaint; both times, the section is merely included in a litany of TVPA 
sections allegedly violated by Epstein, as follows: 
33.  
By virtue of Defendant’s violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 1593A, and 1594, 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Khan [sic] as Joint Personal 
Representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein is subject to civil causes of action 
under 18 U.S.C. § 1595 by Plaintiff, who is a victim of the violations. 
36.  
As direct and proximate result of Defendant’s commission of the 
aforementioned criminal offenses enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 1591, 1593A, and 
1594, and the associated civil remedies provide in § 1595, Plaintiff has in the past 
suffered and will continue to suffer injury and pain; emotional distress; 
psychological and psychiatric trauma; mental anguish; humiliation; confusion; 
embarrassment; loss of self-esteem; loss of dignity; loss of enjoyment of life; 
invasion of privacy; and other damages associated with actions. Plaintiff will incur 
further legal, medical and psychological expenses. These injuries are permanent in 
nature and Plaintiff will continue to suffer from them in the future. In addition to 
these losses, Plaintiff has incurred attorneys’ fees and will be required do so in the 
future. 
(Emphasis added.) Plaintiff does not allege that Epstein benefitted financially or received anything 
of value from his participation in a venture that violated the TVPA.3 Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to 
adequately plead a claim under TVPA § 1593A, and the Court must dismiss that claim. 
II.
Plaintiff’s TVPA Claim Is Largely, If Not Entirely, Time-Barred To The Extent It Is 
Based On Conduct Occurring Before March 17, 2010 
Plaintiff’s TVPA claim is at least partially time-barred. The TVPA expressly provides that 
a victim of a TVPA violation may not bring a civil action under the Act later than “10 years after 
3 This claim also fails because Plaintiff did not adequately plead an underlying violation of § 1591, as explained, 
supra, in Section I(a). See St. Louis v. Perlitz, No. 3:13-CV-1132 (RNC), 2016 WL 1408076, at *3 (D. Conn. Apr. 8, 
2016) (finding a violation against one who “knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from 
participation in a venture which that person knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation of [the 
TVPA]” “requires an underlying violation of § 1591 (or another section of the statute), and plaintiffs have failed to 
allege such a violation”).

the cause of action arose,” where the victim was an adult at the time of the violation. 18 U.S.C. § 
1595(c)(1).  
Here, Plaintiff alleges she was an adult when the alleged abuse began. (Compl. ¶ 3.) 
Therefore, and consistent with Lisa Doe, Plaintiff’s claim in her March 17, 2020 Complaint is 
untimely to the extent it is based on alleged conduct that occurred before March 17, 2010. See 18 
U.S.C. § 1595(c)(1); Lisa Doe v. Indyke, 465 F. Supp. 3d 452, 462 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (Ramos, J.) 
(“While the Court disagrees that the conspiracy claims are time-barred, Doe has not presented 
arguments as to why the non-conspiracy claims, such as attempt, referenced in Counts VI to IX 
are not time-barred and the Court dismisses those with prejudice.”) (dismissing with prejudice 
TVPA Section 1591, 1594(a), and 1593A claims as untimely). 
Lisa Doe is directly on point. In that case, another alleged victim of Epstein sued the Co-
Executors for, among other things, TVPA violations. 465 F. Supp. 3d 452. The Co-Executors 
moved to dismiss Lisa Doe’s TVPA claims as untimely to the extent they were based on conduct 
occurring outside the limitations period, i.e., more than ten years before Lisa Doe filed her 
complaint. Id. at 462. Judge Ramos granted the Co-Executors’ motion in part, dismissing all TVPA 
claims except the conspiracy claim,4 to the extent they were based on alleged conduct occurring 
more than ten years before Lisa Doe filed her complaint. Id.
Under Lisa Doe, the Court must dismiss Plaintiff’s non-conspiracy TVPA claim as 
untimely to the extent it is based on conduct that occurred more than ten years before Plaintiff filed 
her Complaint. Because Plaintiff’s only specific allegation of abuse (Compl. ¶ 28) does not 
4 Judge Ramos found that Lisa Doe’s TVPA conspiracy claims were not time-barred “provided ‘at least one overt act 
in furtherance of the conspiratorial agreement’ occurred within the limitations period.” 465 F. Supp. 3d at 462 (quoting 
United States v. Ben Zvi, 242 F.3d 89, 97 (2d. Cir. 2001)). Judge Ramos found that, as Lisa Doe pleaded an overt act 
within the limitations period, her TVPA conspiracy should not be dismissed on the pleadings. Id. In this action, the 
Co-Executors do not seek to dismiss Plaintiff’s TVPA conspiracy claim as time-barred. (They do move to dismiss 
such claim as inadequately pleaded, as explained above in Section I(b).)

119125600
demonstrate a commercial sex act—or any other nexus to the TVPA—Plaintiff has not pleaded 
any alleged conduct violating the TVPA within the limitations period. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s 
claim should be dismissed as untimely in its entirety. However, even if this Court finds that the 
allegation in Paragraph 28 sufficiently pleads a violation of the TVPA, the Court must still dismiss 
the claim to the extent it is based on conduct that occurred before March 17, 2010. 
III.
Plaintiff Is Not Entitled To Punitive Damages As A Matter Of Law  
Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages must be dismissed as a matter of law. As a 
threshold matter, “where punitive damages have been unavailable as a matter of law, courts have 
not hesitated to dismiss prayers for such damages at the threshold.” Mary Doe v. Indyke, 457 F. 
Supp. 3d 278, 283-84 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (Engelmayer, J.) (dismissing punitive damages demand at 
pleadings stage) (citing Murtha v. N.Y. State Gaming Comm’n, No. 17 Civ. 10040 (NSR), 2019 
WL 4450687, at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2019) (dismissing plaintiff’s demand for punitive 
damages because statute “does not provide for punitive damages”); Rosen v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., 
No. 18 Civ. 6670 (AT), 2019 WL 4039958, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2019) (granting motion to 
dismiss demand for punitive damages where statute did not permit a plaintiff to recover punitive 
damages); Talarico v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 367 F. Supp. 3d 161, 172 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) 
(dismissing demand for punitive damages against Port Authority where “the Third Circuit and the 
overwhelming majority of district courts within this Circuit have held that punitive damages are 
not available against” that defendant (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Canete v. 
Metro. Transp. Auth., No. 17 Civ. 3961 (PAE), 2018 WL 4538897, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2018) 
(dismissing demand for punitive damages where such relief was “precluded as a matter of law”);  
SJB ex rel. Berkhout v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 03 Civ. 6653 (NRB), 2004 WL 1586500, at *8 
(S.D.N.Y. July 14, 2004) (dismissing punitive damages claim because such damages are 
unavailable in § 1983 actions against municipalities)).

119125600
As Judge Ramos held in Lisa Doe, “punitive damages under the TVPA are not available 
after a defendant has died.” 465 F. Supp. 3d at 471 (dismissing with prejudice plaintiff’s claim for 
punitive damages under the TVPA against the Co-Executors). “As a general matter with regards 
to claims brought under federal law, ‘[u]nless a statute directly addresses the issue, courts are 
generally guided by principles of federal common law, which prescribe that claims characterized 
as “penal” abate upon a party’s death, while claims characterized as “remedial” survive.’” Id.
(citing U.S. ex rel. Colucci v. Beth Israel Med. Ctr., 603 F. Supp. 2d 677, 680 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)); 
see also Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Exeter Holdings, Ltd. v. Haltman, 13-cv-5475 
(JS) (AKT), 2017 WL 9485707, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2017). “Even where a statute is 
characterized as remedial, however, courts have found punitive damages unavailable.” Lisa Doe, 
465 F. Supp. 3d at 471 (citing Estwick v. U.S. Air Shuttle, 950 F. Supp. 493, 498 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) 
(“The punitive damages are plainly penal….”); EEOC v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, No. 97 Civ. 
6484 (LMM), 2000 WL 1024700, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2000)). In fact, even where a federal 
cause of action survives death, punitive damages remain unavailable. See, e.g., Medrano v. MCDR, 
Inc., 366 F. Supp. 2d 625, 635 (W.D. Tenn. 2005) (dismissing deceased plaintiff’s claim for 
punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1981). 
Accordingly, under this Court’s directly applicable precedent analyzing similar same 
claims and issues against the same defendants, punitive damages are unavailable to Plaintiff and 
her demand for those damages must be dismissed. See Lisa Doe, 465 F. Supp. 3d at 471. 
IV.
Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, the Co-Executors respectfully request that the Court grant their 
Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint, together with such other and further relief as the Court 
deems just and proper.
