INTRODUCTION 
INDICTMENT 
830 
1. 
On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL 
THOMAS, 
the 
defendants, 
in dereliction 
of their duties 
as 
correctional officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
("MCC"), repeatedly failed to perform mandated counts of prisoners 
under their watch in the MCC' s Special Housing Unit 
("SHU"). 
Instead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS 
sat at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the 
common area of the SHU. 
To conceal their failure to perform their 
duties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications 
attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates when, in 
truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. 
As a result 
of those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU 
were being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in fact, as 
a result of the defendants' 
conduct, 
no correctional officer 
conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 10:30 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 2 of 20
p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at 
which time, as alleged herein, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body 
of an MCC 
inmate, Jeffrey Epstein, who had committed suicide 
overnight while unobserved. 
RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES 
2. 
The 
MCC 
is a 
federal administrative detention 
facility located in Manhattan that is run by the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons ("BOP"). 
The MCC is one of several facilities used to 
house inmates who have been charged with federal crimes in the 
Southern District of New York and are awaiting trial. 
The MCC 
employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is to ensure the 
care, custody, and control of the inmate population of the MCC. 
3. 
TOVA NOEL, the defendant, has been employed as a 
correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2016. 
As of 
August 2019, NOEL's primary assignment was the SHU. 
On August 9, 
2019, NOEL worked a regular shift from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. in the 
SHU, and then worked an overtime shift from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. on 
August 10, 2019, also in the SHU. 
NOEL had also worked a regular 
shift in the SHU the day before, August 8, 2019, from 12 p.m. to 
8 p.m. 
4. 
MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, has been employed as 
a 
correctional officer at the 
MCC 
since approximately 2007. 
Beginning in approximately 2013, THOMAS was assigned to work as a 
2 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 3 of 20
materials handler supervisor, al though THOMAS regularly worked 
overtime shifts as a correctional officer, including in the SHU. 
THOMAS worked an overtime shift in the SHU on August 10, 2019, 
from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. 
THOMAS did not work his regular shift on 
August 8 or August 9, 2019, but did work an overtime shift in the 
SHU on August 9, 2019 from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. 
5. 
As 
detailed 
herein, 
Jeffrey 
Epstein 
was 
incarcerated at the MCC between his arrest on July 6, 2019, and 
his suicide on August 10, 2019. 
Epstein was detained pending 
trial in the Southern District of New York on sex trafficking 
charges. 
THE MCC AND INSTITUTIONAL COUNTS 
6. 
The MCC, which houses approximately 750 inmates at 
any given time, assigns inmates to various housing units within 
the MCC. 
The SHU is a housing unit within the MCC where inmates 
are securely separated from the general inmate population to ensure 
their own safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates. 
The SHU is located on the ninth floor of the MCC, and access to 
that floor is controlled by a locked door that can be opened 
remotely only by an officer in the MCC's centralized control center 
(the "Control Centern), which is located on the first floor of the 
MCC. 
Access into the SHU is also controlled by a second locked 
door to which only correctional officers assigned to the SHU have 
3 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 4 of 20
keys while on duty. 
Within the SHU, inmates are assigned to six 
separate tiers, each of which can be accessed only via a single 
locked door to which the correctional officers assigned to the SHU 
have keys while on duty. 
Each tier has eight cells, each of which 
can house either one or two prisoners, and each individual cell -
which is made of cement and metal -
is accessed only through a 
single locked door, to which only correctional officers assigned 
to the SHU have keys while on duty. 
7. 
The BOP requires correctional officers assigned to 
guard inmates at the MCC to conduct institution-wide counts of 
inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate 
is alive and accounted for within the MCC 
(the "institutional 
count") 
On weekdays, the MCC conducts five institutional counts 
at 4 p.m., 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. 
Performing an 
institutional count is one of the most basic and essential aspects 
of a correctional officer's job, and the count is one of the most 
basic and essential functions of daily operation of the MCC. 
Two 
officers are required to perform the institutional count for each 
housing unit, including the SHU, 
and are further required to 
document their performance of the count on an official MCC form 
called a count slip. 
To perform the institutional count in the 
SHU, two officers must walk from tier to tier to observe and count 
each individual inmate. 
4 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 5 of 20
8. 
On the count slip, both correctional officers are 
required to fill in the date and time the count was performed, 
write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
counted, and then sign the count slip. 
Once the correctional 
officers have completed and signed the count slips, the count slips 
are then collected and delivered to the Control Center, where 
officers within the Control Center are responsible for comparing 
the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate 
roster to ensure that each inmate is accounted for. 
Only after 
all the count slips are collected from each housing unit, and the 
numbers on the slips are matched to the institution's inmate 
roster, 
can the institutional count 
be 
deemed 
"cleared" or 
completed. 
incomplete, 
If a 
housing unit's count slip is incorrect or 
then the 
institution cannot 
"clear" 
the 
count. 
Instead, the count must be completely redone in that housing unit 
via a more-intensive version of the institutional count called a 
"bed book count," in which officers must compare every individual 
inmate to the institution's inmate roster. 
Records of each 
institutional count, including the count slips, are provided to a 
supervising official and retained by the MCC. 
9. 
In addition to the institutional count, the BOP 
requires correctional officers assigned to the SHU to walk each of 
the tiers of the SHU -
which is called a "round" -
every thirty 
5 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 6 of 20
minutes 
("30-minute rounds"). 
Like the institutional counts, 
correctional officers conduct 30-minute rounds to ensure that each 
inmate is alive and accounted for within his cell. 
Correctional 
officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form, which 
is reviewed and signed by their supervisor, documenting the date 
and time of each 30-minute round in each tier of the SHU. 
EPSTEIN'S PRIOR APPARENT SUICIDE ATTEMPT 
10. On 
July 
6, 
2019, 
inmate 
Jeffrey Epstein 
was 
arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking charges. 
On 
July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the SHU due to, among other 
things, risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns relating 
to housing him with the MCC's general population. 
11. On July 23, 2019, while Epstein was housed in the 
SHU, MCC officers responded to an emergency call, and found Epstein 
on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. 
MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, was one of the MCC officers who 
responded to the incident. 
Epstein was subsequently transferred 
out of the SHU and was placed on suicide watch. 
Inmates placed 
on suicide watch are housed in a cell on the hospital wing floor 
of the MCC, 
and are watched twenty-four hours a day by a staff 
member or a specially trained inmate companion. 
12. Epstein remained on suicide watch for approximately 
twenty-four hours, 
and then was transferred to psychological 
6 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 7 of 20
observation, until July 30, 2019. 
Psychological observation is 
less restrictive than suicide watch, but inmates are still housed 
in the hospital wing of the MCC and watched twenty-four hours a 
day. 
13. On July 30, 2019, Epstein was transferred back to 
the SHU, and, at the direction of the MCC's psychological staff, 
was required to have an assigned cellmate. 
Epstein was also 
assigned to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk in 
the common area of the SHU, which was approximately fifteen feet 
from the cell. 
Conducting the required institutional counts and 
thirty-minute rounds in the SHU 
were also part of the MCC' s 
procedures for ensuring the safety of inmates, including Epstein. 
EVENTS OF AUGUST 9-10, 2019 
14. On 
August 
9, 
2019, 
Epstein's 
cellmate 
was 
transferred out of the MCC in a routine, pre-arranged transfer at 
approximately 8 a .m. 
Despite the MCC' s psychological staff's 
direction that Epstein have a 
cellmate, 
no new cellmate· was 
assigned to Epstein's cell. 
15. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, was one of the assigned 
officers on duty in the SHU from 4 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to 8 
a.m. on August 10. 
From 4 p.m. to 12 a.m., two other officers 
were on duty with NOEL in the SHU: one officer was assigned to 
work from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. ("Officer-1"), and one officer was 
7 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 8 of 20
assigned to work from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. ("Officer-2") 
MICHAEL 
THOMAS, the defendant, started his shift in the SHU at 12 a.m. on 
August 10. 
From 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, NOEL and THOMAS 
were the only two officers on duty in the SHU. 
16. During the time period from 4 p.m. on August 9 to 
8 a.m. on August 10, the officers on duty in the SHU, including 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were responsible for 
conducting five institutional counts: 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 
9; and 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. on August 10. 
NOEL, THOMAS and 
the other officers on duty were also responsible for completing 
paperwork attesting to each of those counts. 
While, as detailed 
herein, count slips were completed for each institutional count, 
in fact, not a single one of those institutional counts was done. 
17. TOVA 
NOEL, 
the 
defendant, 
and 
Officer-1 
were 
responsible for conducting the 4 p.m. institutional count in the 
SHU. 
As video from the MCC's internal video surveillance system 
makes clear, NOEL and Officer-1 did not perform the 4 p.m. count. 
Nonetheless, NOEL and Officer-1 completed and signed a count slip 
that falsely stated that the 4 p.m. institutional count had been 
performed. 
In 
reliance 
on 
that 
falsified 
count 
slip, 
at 
approximately 5:03 p.m., the Control Center cleared the 4 p.m. 
count. 
8 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 9 of 20
18. That evening, Epstein returned to the SHU from his 
attorney visit and was escorted into his cell by TOVA NOEL, the 
defendant, and another officer at approximately 7:49 p.m. 
NOEL 
and the other officer left the tier in which Epstein was housed 
immediately thereafter. 
19. By or before 10 p.m., all inmates in the MCC were 
locked in their cells for the night. 
At or around that time, TOVA 
NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-2 were responsible for conducting 
the 10 p.m. institutional count in the SHU. 
However, video from 
the MCC's internal video surveillance system shows that NOEL and 
Officer-2 did not perform the 10 p.m. count. 
Nonetheless, NOEL 
and Officer-2 completed and signed a count slip falsely stating 
that the 10 p.m. institutional count had been performed. 
In 
reliance on that falsified count slip, at approximately 10:36 p.m., 
the Control Center cleared the 10 p.m. count. 
20. As 
reflected on video obtained from the MCC' s 
internal video surveillance system, at approximately 10:30 p.m. on 
August 9, 2019 -
after TOVA NOEL, the defendant, had signed and 
submitted the 10 p.m. count slip and the institutional count had 
been completed -
NOEL briefly walked up to, and then walked back 
from, 
the door to the tier in which Epstein was housed. 
As 
confirmed by the video obtained from the MCC' s internal video 
surveillance system, this was the last time anyone, including any 
9 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 10 of 20
correctional officer, walked up to, let alone entered, the only 
entrance 
to 
the 
tier 
in 
which 
Epstein 
was 
housed 
until 
approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
21. Officer-1' s shift ended at approximately 10 p.m., 
and at approximately 12 a.m., 
MICHAEL 
THOMAS, 
the defendant, 
replaced Officer-2, joining TOVA NOEL, the defendant, as the only 
two correctional officers on duty in the SHU. 
NOEL and THOMAS 
were responsible for conducting the 12 a.m. institutional count in 
the SHU. 
As confirmed by video from the MCC' s internal video 
surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not perform the 12 a.m. 
count. 
Nonetheless, NOEL and THOMAS completed and signed a count 
slip for 
the 
12 
a.m. 
count 
that 
falsely stated that the 
institutional count had been performed. 
In reliance on that 
falsified count slip, at approximately 12: 49 a.m., the Control 
Center cleared the 12 a.m. count. 
22. 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were 
additionally responsible for conducting the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts in the SHU. 
As confirmed by video from the 
MCC's internal video surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not 
perform either the 3 a.m. or the 5 a.m. counts. 
NOEL and THOMAS 
nonetheless completed and signed count slips for both counts that 
falsely stated that they had performed the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts. 
In reliance on those falsified count slips, 
10 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 11 of 20
at approximately 3:24 a.m. 
and 5:30 a.m., the Control Center 
cleared the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts, respectively. 
23. Moreover, despite the requirement that officers on 
duty in the SHU conduct and document regular, 30-minute rounds, 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, did not perform any 
of the required 30-minute rounds during their shift between 
approximately 12 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. 
Nonetheless, NOEL completed 
and signed more than 75 separate 30-minute round entries falsely 
affirming that they had, in fact, conducted such rounds. 
24. During 
the 
night, 
instead 
of 
completing 
the 
required counts and rounds, 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, 
the 
defendants, were seated at the correctional officers' desk in the 
SHU 
common area 
(as noted above, 
approximately 15 feet from 
Epstein's cell), used the computers, and moved around the SHU 
common area. 
For a period of approximately two hours, NOEL and 
THOMAS sat at their desk without moving, and appeared to have been 
asleep. 
NOEL used the computer periodically throughout the night, 
including to search the internet for furniture sales and benefit 
websites. 
THOMAS used the computer briefly around 1 a.m., 4 a.m., 
and 6 a.m. to search for motorcycle sales and sports news. 
25. At approximately 4 a.m., the overnight supervisor 
briefly visited NOEL and THOMAS in the SHU, and conferred with 
NOEL and THOMAS, who were seated at and around the officers' desk, 
11 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 12 of 20
before leaving. 
At approximately 5:30 a.m., another correctional 
officer briefly walked through the SHU common area. 
Aside from 
those two officers, as confirmed by video surveillance, no one 
else entered the SHU, 
no one conducted any counts or rounds 
throughout the night, and no one entered the tier in which Epstein 
was housed. 
26. Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, MICHAEL 
THOMAS 
and TOVA NOEL, 
the defendants, received a delivery of 
breakfast carts into the SHU, after which time they were again the 
only officers in the SHU. 
Shortly after 6:30 a.m., NOEL and THOMAS 
walked up to and entered the tier in which Epstein was housed to 
serve breakfast. 
At approximately 6:33 a.m., 
an alarm was 
activated in the SHU. 
Epstein was alone in his cell and not 
responsive, with a noose around his neck. 
A supervisor who had 
just started his shift ("Supervisor-1") responded to the alarm 
almost immediately thereafter, and as NOEL approached the door to 
the SHU to open the door for Supervisor-1, NOEL told Supervisor-1 
that 
"Epstein 
hung 
himself." 
After arriving in the 
SHU, 
Supervisor-1 spoke with THOMAS and NOEL. 
NOEL told Supervisor-1 
"we did not complete the 3 a.m. nor 5 a.m. rounds." 
THOMAS stated, 
"we messed up," and "I messed up, she's not to blame, we didn't do 
any rounds." 
12 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 13 of 20
27. Epstein was transferred to a local hospital where 
he was declared dead shortly thereafter. 
The Office of the Chief 
Medical Examiner of the City of New York conducted an autopsy and 
determined that Epstein had committed suicide by hanging himself.
