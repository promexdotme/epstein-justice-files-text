19 Civ. 10474 
Having reviewed the parties' pre-motion letters, see ECF Nos. 
13, 14, the Court has determined that the defendants may bring 
their motion without the necessity of a pre-motion conference. 
The 
Court notes that if , 
consistent with Rule 
11, 
the 
plaintiff can assert additional allegations to cure any alleged 
deficiencies raised by the defendants' letter, it would be in the 
best interest of both the parties and the Court for the plaintiff 
to assert them now, before briefing on the proposed motion. 
The 
plaintiff is thus granted leave to file an amended complaint within 
two (2) weeks of this Order. 
At that time, if no amended complaint 
has been filed, the parties should confer on a briefing schedule 
agreeable to both sides, in which no more than sixty (60) days 
elapse from the filing of the defendants' motion to the filing of 
the defendants' reply.
