Re: 
Jane Doe 1000 v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn in their capacities as the 
executors of the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Case No. 19-cv-10577-LGS
Dear Judge Schofield: 
We represent Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein (together, “Defendants”) in the referenced action.  Defendants respectfully request that 
the Court refer this action to Magistrate Judge Debra C. Freeman for General Pretrial (including 
scheduling, discovery, non-dispositive pretrial motions, and settlement).  Plaintiff consents to 
this request. 
As a matter of context, several other Judges in this District have collectively referred to 
Magistrate Freeman for General Pretrial numerous actions against Defendants in their 
capacities as Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, including two actions in which 
the parties are represented by the respective counsel of record in this action.1  Magistrate 
Freeman held a status conference on November 21, 2019, which counsel of record for the 
parties to this action attended.  Magistrate Freeman requested the parties in the matters 
referred to Her Honor to submit status reports on January 10, 2020.

Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Case No. 19-cv-10476-PGG-DCF, Order of Reference (ECF Doc. 6)

the executors of the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Case No. 19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF, Order of
