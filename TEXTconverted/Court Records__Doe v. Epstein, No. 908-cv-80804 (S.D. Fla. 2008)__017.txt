CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Pursuant to Rule 5 .4 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court 
for the Southern District of Florida, defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen 
hereby move to file their motion for stay, as well as this motion, under seal, stating 
as follows: 
1. 
In their motion for stay, defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen 
refer to a confidential agreement between the United States Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of Florida and Jeffrey Epstein. 
2. 
The information contained in the confidential agreement is material to 
this Court's consideration of the defendants' motion for stay. 
3. 
To avoid disclosure of confidential material, the defendants request 
leave to file their motion for stay, and this motion, under seal. 
4. 
We recognize that this Court has previously unsealed documents 
referring to this same agreement. We mean in no way to disregard that order, but 
seek merely to comply with the confidentiality clause in that agreement for this 
new and independent filing, in an abundance of caution, until directed otherwise by 
the Court. 
5. 
The undersigned are authorized to represent that defendant Sarah 
Kellen joins in this motion.
