PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWERS TO PLAINTFF’S FIRST 
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 
 
 
Plaintiff Jane Doe, hereby moves this Court for an order compelling defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, to answer her first request for production or, in the alternative, to prove 
that his invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege is proper.  Jane Doe also requests 
production of a privilege log. 
 
Jane Doe has propounded 16 requests for production, including such 
straightforward requests as requests for production of: 
Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 60   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 4 of 16

 
                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
 
5
 
Request No. 1: Copies of all telephone records; 
 
Request No. 2: Photos of the inside of your home located at 358 El Brillo Way, 
Palm Beach, Florida, that depict the room(s) where massages took place (including 
massage table).  
 
Request No. 10:  Correspondence between Epstein and federal prosecutors; 
 
Request No. 12:  Personal tax returns; 
 
Request No. 13:  Photocopies of Epstein’s passport;  
Request No. 14:  A statement of net worth; and  
 
Request No. 16:  Medical records. 
 
In response to each and every one of these requests, Epstein has given the 
following response (with only minor variations here and there): 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under 
the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
 
 
This Court should order Epstein to provide all of the requested information or, in 
the alternative, prove that his Fifth Amendment invocations are valid. It is for the court, 
not the claimant, to determine whether the hazard of incrimination is justified.  United 
States v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir. 1991).  “A court must make a 
particularized inquiry, deciding, in connection with each specific area that the 
Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 60   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 5 of 16

 
                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON

questioning party wishes to explore, whether or not the privilege is well-founded.” Id.  
Typically this is done in an in camera proceeding wherein the person asserting the 
privilege is given the opportunity “to substantiate his claims of the privilege and the 
district court is able to consider the questions asked and the documents requested by 
the summons.”  Id.  
 
Here Epstein has made boilerplate invocation of the Fifth Amendment to each 
and every request propounded by Jane Doe, including for example the request for 
correspondence with federal prosecutors and for production of federal tax returns.  This 
obviously is not a request with Fifth Amendment implications, as the information has 
already been fully disclosed to the Government.   
 
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the requests or 
provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment invocation with regard to 
each request. 
Epstein’s “cut and paste” response to the request for production also blatantly 
disregards the requirements for invoking privilege under the Court’s local rules.  Local 
rule 26.1.G very specifically requires the preparation of a privilege log with respect to all 
documents and oral communications (among other things) that are withheld on the 
basis of privilege.  Epstein has failed to prepare such a log, making it impossible for 
Jane Doe to effectively challenge his generic assertions.  Indeed, with respect to a few 
requests, Epstein has stated: “Further, the request may include information subject to 
work product or an attorney-client privilege.”  Of course, the whole purpose of forcing a 
defendant to prepare a privilege log is to force the defendant to decide whether or not 
Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 60   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 6 of 16

 
                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
 
7
information is privileged.  An assertion that something “may” be privileged is obviously 
woefully deficient.  The Local Rules do not permit this tactic, and Epstein should be (at a 
minimum) promptly required to produce a privilege log.   
 
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to provide a privilege log 
and to answer the interrogatories or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth 
Amendment invocation with regard to each request. 
 
It should be noted that (with minor exceptions) the only grounds on which Epstein 
can refuse to answer the request for production is proof of a valid Fifth Amendment 
privilege.  This the only objection Epstein has asserted (with minor exceptions).  As a 
result, any other objections to production are deemed waived.  See Local Rule 
26.1G.3.(a) (“Any ground [for an objection] not stated in an objection within the time 
provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or any extensions thereof, shall be 
waived.”). 
SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION 
 
For the convenience of the court – and in compliance with Local Rule 26.1 H 
(party filing motion to compel shall list specific requests in succession) – Jane Doe’s 
requests for production and Epstein’s objections are as follows: 
Request No. 1:  Copies of all telephone records in your or your attorney’s possession 
from 2002 through 2005 that in any way relate to you (including all phone lines owned 
by you or that were used to contact girls for the purposes of scheduling massages for 
you.) 
 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective

representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under 
the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
 
Request No. 2:  All massage appointment books, diaries, computer calendars or 
scheduling entities, scheduling books or any other writing or correspondence that 
contains the names of any of the girls that were called, contacted, scheduled or who 
otherwise went to your home located at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida, for the 
purpose of giving you a massage.

name or that refers to Plaintiff, directly or indirectly, (includes e-mails, letters, message 
pads, diaries, appointment books, computer print outs).

1 Jane Doe does not intend to use these materials to draw a forbidden inference of guilt from the mere 
fact that information was provided to law enforcement officials as part of plea discussions, but rather for 
other purposes.  These materials are also quite clearly likely to lead to the discovery of other admissible 
evidence, as they relate to the same subject matter as this lawsuit.  To the extent that Epstein relies on 
the non-prosecution agreement, nothing in that agreement bars discovery of information relevant to this 
lawsuit.

protections and privileges, the scope of information is so overbroad that it 
seeks information that is neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead 
to the discovery of admissible evidence; compiling such information over a 
six year period would be unduly burdensome and time consuming.4

4 Jane Doe believes that Epstein used overseas travel as a means of obtaining underage girls for sexual 
purposes and for avoiding criminal prosecution for such activities.  Also, providing a copy of a passport is 
hardly “burdensome.”  Also, given the fact that Epstein is likely to have used the services of a travel agent 
or another intermediary, it should not be difficult for him to provide evidence of his overseas travels from 
such intermediaries.

CONCLUSION 
 
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the request for 
production, or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment invocation 
with regard to each request.  Epstein should also be required to provide a privilege log.  
Counsel for Jane Doe have conferred with opposing counsel on the issues raised in this 
motion, and no resolution was possible.
