PLAINTIFF, CAROLYN M. ANDRIANO’S, RESPONSE TO THIRD PARTY WITNESS, 
IGOR ZINOVIEW’S, MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND INCORPORATED 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
 
 
Plaintiff, Carolyn M. Andriano, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby 
files her Response Third Party Witness, Igor Zinoview’s, Motion For Protective Order 
and Incorporated Memorandum of Law (D.E. 402), and in support thereof states as 
follows: 
 
1. 
Third party witness, Igor Zinoview, seeks to have this Court enter an order 
preventing his deposition from going forward at all, or, in the alternative, limiting the 
scope of permissible questioning during same.  Mr. Zinoview’s deposition is presently 
scheduled to be taken on December 18, 2009. 
 
2. 
Mr. Zinoview has been employed by Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, as his 
“driver, bodyguard, and trainer” since November of 2005.  See Affidavit of Igor Zinoview 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 1 of 8

(D.E. 402) dated November 9, 2009.  Mr. Zinoview argues that his deposition should not 
go forward as scheduled because Defendant Epstein has never discussed nor 
attempted to discuss with him “any facts or information related to any legal matters in 
which he [Jeffrey Epstein] is involved.” Id.  From Mr. Zinoview’s vague assertion springs 
the bold yet erroneous argument that “Mr. Zinoview cannot possibly have any 
knowledge or information that is presently germane to this action.” 
 
3. 
It should initially be noted that a “complete prohibition of a deposition is an 
extraordinary measure which should be resorted to only in rare occasions.” Jennings v. 
Family Management, 201 F.R.D. 272 (D.D.C. 2001); See also, Salter v. Upjohn Co., 
593 F.2d 649, 651 (5th Circ. 1979)(It is very unusual for trial court to prohibit the taking 
of a deposition altogether, and absent extraordinary circumstances, such order would 
likely be in error.); Inv. Properties Intern., Ltd. v. IOS, Ltd., 459 F.2d. 705, 708 (2d Circ. 
1972)(“an order to vacate a notice of taking deposition is generally regarded as both 
unusual and unfavorable . . . “).  Neither Mr. Zinoview’s conclusory affidavit nor his 
Motion provide anything even approaching the “extraordinary circumstances” necessary 
to justify the entry of order precluding his deposition from going forward at all. 
 
4. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview’s vague assertion that he and Defendant 
Epstein have never discussed any facts or information related to any legal matters that 
Mr. Epstein is involved in does not give rise to requisite “extraordinary circumstances” 
either. Detweiler Bros, Inc. v John Graham and Company, 412 F.Supp. 416 (E.D. Wash, 
1976)(Plaintiff could not properly seek to prohibit defendant from deposing plaintiff’s 
employee via a protective order on grounds that employee had no knowledge of matters 
at issue.) See also, 8 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. §2037, Wright and Miller(“A witness 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 2 of 8

ordinarily cannot escape examination by denying knowledge of any relevant facts, since 
the party seeking to take the deposition is entitled to test the witness’s lack of 
knowledge.”)  
 
5. 
The undersigned, as well as counsel for all of the other victims of Jeffrey 
Epstein, are entitled to question and challenge Mr. Zinoview on his purported lack of 
knowledge.  Mr. Zinoview and plaintiffs’ counsel very well might have a difference of 
opinion on what constitutes “facts and information related to any legal matters” in which 
Defendant Epstein is involved.  The victims of Jeffrey Epstein ought not to be forced to 
accept Mr. Zinoview’s opinion as to what constitutes “facts and information related to 
any legal matters” involving Jeffrey Epstein.  Instead, plaintiffs should be able to explore 
these relevant matters directly with Mr. Zinoview, rather than being forced to rely on his 
twenty seven (27) word claim of lacking any knowledge. 
 
6. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview worked for Defendant Epstein during portions of 
the Palm Beach Police Department’s months’ long investigation which spanned from 
March 15, 2005 through February 2006 into the illegal sexual contact committed by 
Defendant Epstein against these minor plaintiffs.  Accordingly, Mr. Zinoview certainly 
might have direct knowledge about what was going on in and around the Epstein 
residence during the time period in which he was employed by Defendant Epstein as his 
“driver, bodyguard, and trainer” while his employer was being investigated by law 
enforcement.  Given the Defendant’s voracious invocation of his Fifth Amendment 
privilege, the plaintiffs have consistently been denied the opportunity to seek any 
relevant information directly from Defendant Epstein himself.  Rather, plaintiffs have 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 3 of 8

been forced to build their cases against Mr. Epstein by other discovery methods, 
including deposing his employees who may have relevant information.  
 
7. 
Third party witness Igor Zinoview has failed to meet his very high burden 
of establishing “extraordinary circumstances.”  Mr. Zinoview has failed to demonstrate 
the “good cause” required by Rule 26(c) to protect a person from “annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense” to overcome the liberal 
scope of permissible discovery.  The above proposed lines of inquiry of Mr. Zinoview 
are certainly reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  
Accordingly, to the extent that it seeks to preclude his deposition from going forward at 
all, Mr. Zinoview’s Motion should be denied 
 
8. 
Next, Mr. Zinoview also seeks to prevent questions being posed to him 
wherein he is first asked to “assume certain facts about which he has no knowledge,” 
and then be asked about his “opinions about certain facts.”  First, it remains to be seen 
exactly what facts about which Mr. Zinoview has no knowledge.  Second, Mr. Zinoview’s 
opinions and beliefs about the factual matters surrounding plaintiffs’ claims are relevant 
to exploring any potential bias and prejudice in favor of his employer and against 
Defendant Epstein’s victims.  For example, if Mr. Zinoview believes that these plaintiffs 
are simply inventing their claims against his employer that they were sexually victimized 
by Defendant Epstein while they were minor children, it very well might impact his 
impartiality as a witness.  Third, the undersigned has no present intention of engaging in 
this line of questioning unless the proverbial “door” has been opened by Mr. Zinoview 
first.  Lastly, counsel for Mr. Zinoview is certainly free to invoke the privileges afforded to 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 4 of 8

him by the applicable procedural rules should he feel that his client is being asked 
inappropriate questions during the deposition. 
 
9. 
In conclusion and for the reasons cited above, Mr. Zinoview’s Motion For 
Protective Order should be denied in its entirety. 
 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Carolyn Margaret Andriano, respectfully requests that 
this Court deny Third Party Igor Zinoview’s Motion For Protective Order.
