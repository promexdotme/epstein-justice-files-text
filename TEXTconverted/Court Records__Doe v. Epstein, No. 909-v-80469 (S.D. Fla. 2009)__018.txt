3 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2009   Page 4 of 6
to Compel and/or Identify C. M.A. in the Style of This Case and Motion to Identify C. M.A. 
in Third-Party Subpoenas For Purposes of Discovery, or, Alternatively, Motion to 
Dismiss Sua Sponte, With Incorporated Memorandum of Law, and further states as 
follows: 
1. 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, filed a Motion to Compel and/or Identify 
C. M.A. in the Style of This Case and Motion to Identify C. M.A. in Third-Party Subpoenas 
For Purposes of Discovery, or, Alternatively, Motion to Dismiss Sua Sponte, With 
Incorporated Memorandum of Law (D.E. 67) on April 29, 2009. 
2. 
EPSTEIN's Motion seeks the following relief (taken verbatim from the 
conclusion of his Motion): 
a) "That C.M.A. be identified by her legal name in the style of this case; 
b) That Epstein be granted leave to identify C.M.A. by her legal name in 
Third-Party Subpoenas (but not file them in Court, or, if required, in a 
redacted form); and 
c) That on an alternative basis, this court dismiss this action Sua Sponte 
until such time as C.M.A. identifies herself in the style of this matter. 
Doe v. Rostker, 89 F.R.D at 163." 
3. 
Plaintiff withdraws her objection to a) and b) requested above. 
The 
request to have C.M.A.'s case dismissed is rendered moot given C.M.A.'s acquiescence 
to a) and b). To the extent that it is not, however, C.M.A. continues to object to c) 
above.
