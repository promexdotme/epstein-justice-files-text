JANE DOE, a/k/a 
JANE DOE NO. 1, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
HALEY ROBSON, and 
SARAH KELLEN 
I 
-----------------
OPPOSITION TO REMAND MOTION 
Because this case was properly removed under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a), remand is 
unwarranted. In response to plaintiffs motion under § 1447(c) for remand and attorneys' fees, 
defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen respectfully state as follows: 
Introduction 
The plaintiff suggests she is insulated from any fraudulent-joinder challenge so long as 
she has "at least a possibility" of "recover[ing] against Defendant Robson under Florida law for 
each of the counts in the amended complaint." (DE 11 at 5.) However superficially appealing 
from a plaintiffs perspective, this argument ignores the corollary that "[t]he potential for legal 
liability [ under State law] 'must be reasonable, not merely theoretical."' Legg v. Wyeth, 428 
F.3d 1317, 1325 n.5 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Great Plains Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter & Co., 313 F.3d 305, 312 (5th Cir. 2002)) (emphasis added). See also id. at 1325 
(observing that "[t]he removal process was created by Congress to protect defendants," adding 
that "Congress 'did not extend such protection with one hand, and with the other give plaintiffs a

bag of tricks to overcome it.'" (quoting McKinney v. Ed. of Trustees of Maryland Cmty. Coll., 
955 F.2d 924, 928 (4th Cir. 1992))). 
Essentially, the remand motion merely re-states the complaint's allegations against 
Robson. This is not enough to rebut fraudulent joinder. Cf Ghiglione v. Discover Prop. & Cas. 
Co., No. C-06-1276 SC, 2006 WL 1095855, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 25, 2006) (denying motion to 
remand where plaintiffs, instead of properly analyzing their alleged cause of action, resorted to 
"quoting from Witkin 's California Procedure a passage that merely repeated the essence of [the 
governing jurisdictional statute]") ( emphasis added). 
Even in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the allegations are insufficient to 
establish a cause of action under Florida law against Haley Robson. 
As a result, after 
discounting this fraudulently joined defendant, there is complete diversity of citizenship, hence, 
original jurisdiction in this Court. 
Discussion 
A. Diversity of Citizenship 
Based on a published newspaper report, our removal petition suggested that Jane Doe, 
despite her allegations of being a citizen of Florida (DE 1 at 62), might actually be a (diverse) 
citizen of Georgia (DE 1 at 7-8 n.6). If so, the case would be removable, regardless of any 
claims against defendant Robson. The plaintiff ignored this point. Instead, the plaintiff claimed 
that "there is a question of whether Defendant Epstein is actually a citizen of Florida because he 
is now incarcerated in a Florida jail." (DE 11 at 2 n.2.) 
This statement, besides being 
nonresponsive, 1 is devoid of merit under binding Eleventh Circuit law, which the plaintiff did not

B. Fraudulent Joinder 
Even if the plaintiff is a citizen of Florida ( after all), there is still complete diversity given 
that "[a] non-diverse defendant who is fraudulently joined does not defeat diversity." Shenkar v. 
Money Warehouse, Inc., No. 07-20634-CIV, 2007 WL 3023531, at *1 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 15, 2007) 
(Moreno, J.) (citing Riley v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 292 F.3d 1334, 1337 
(11th Cir. 2002)); accord, e.g., Tedder v. F.MC. Corp., 590 F.2d 115, 117 (5th Cir. 1979) 
(denying motion to remand where two resident defendants were joined for the fraudulent purpose 
of defeating federal jurisdiction).2 To say it another way, there is no cause of action here against 
Haley Robson, and without Haley Robson, there is complete diversity. 
This plaintiff originally filed this lawsuit in this court. See Doe v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-
80069-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed Jan. 24, 2008). After she was deposed in the state criminal case,3 
she dismissed this suit, switched lawyers, and re-filed her claims in state court (DE 1-2 at 62-
70), adding Haley Robson as a nondiverse defendant in an attempt to prevent removal (DE 1-2 at 
62).4 After Ms. Robson moved to quash service of process in state court (DE 1-2 at 92-96), the

In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (en bane), the Eleventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit 
rendered prior to October 1, 1981. 
3 On February 20, 2008, the plaintiff was deposed in State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, 
502006CF009454 (Fla. 15th Cir. Ct. filed July 19, 2006). During that deposition, she made 
numerous admissions that completely undermined the allegations in her complaint. Two days 
later, she filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice. See Doe v. Epstein, Case No. 
08-CV-80069-KAM, DE 9. 
4 
The plaintiff, apparently to bolster her untenable theories of indirect tort liability, added 
another new defendant, Sarah Kellen. (DE 1-2 at 62.) 
In naming Kellen and Robson as 
defendants, the plaintiff tried to distinguish this case from a series of effectively identical 
lawsuits brought in federal court against Epstein: Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, Case No. 9:08-
CV-80119-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed Feb. 6, 2008); Jane Doe No. 3 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80232-
KAM (S.D. Fla. filed Mar. 5, 2008); Jane Doe No. 4 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80380-KAM (S.D. 
4

CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
plaintiff then amended her complaint to assert an additional claim against Robson (DE 1-3 at 
101-09), re-using the identical, unmodified general allegations. 
Instead of addressing the fact that Robson has "no assets whatever" (DE 1 at 4) and looks 
every bit the sham defendant, the plaintiff maintains that Robson, a college student, was a "key 
player" in an alleged RICO "scheme" (DE 11 at 2). 
Resorting to unswom, inadmissible, 
improper double-hearsay, the plaintiff proclaims that Robson "has described herself as Heidi 
Fleiss" (DE 11 at 1 ), the "notorious Hollywood madam" (DE 11 at 1 n.1) -
as though 
sensationalism could convert Ms. Robson into an actual defendant. This "argument" has nothing 
to do with the issue of removal, offers incompetent non-evidence in an attempt to prejudice the 
analysis, and fails to establish that the amended complaint contains a single viable cause of 
action against Robson. 
1. The plaintiff has not asserted a cause of action against Robson for civil 
conspiracy. 
The plaintiff, citing to Wright v. Yurko, 446 So. 2d 1162, 1165 (Fla. 5th DCA 1984), 
concedes that "there muse [sic] be an 'actionable underlying tort or wrong' for an actionable 
conspiracy claim." (DE 11 at 5.) Yet, the plaintiff still insists that Epstein's "violation of 
Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes" (DE 1-3 at 105) is an adequate the basis for her civil 
conspiracy claim against Robson (DE 1-3 at 105-06), "regardless of whether Defendant 
Epstein's violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes also creates a private right of action" 
(DE 11 at 6). This makes no sense. 
As we argued in the removal petition, it is not enough to allege that Robson "merely ... 
'conspired to cause ham1"'; again, "[u]nder Florida law, '[a]n actionable conspiracy requires an 
Fla. filed Apr. 14, 2008); Jane Doe No. 5 v. Epstein, No. 08-80381-CV-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed 
Apr. 14, 2008).

actionable underlying tort or wrong."' Posner v. Essex Ins. Co., 178 F.3d 1209, 1217-18 (11th 
Cir. 1999) (quoting Florida Fern Growers Ass'n v. Concerned Citizens, 616 So. 2d 562, 565 
(Fla. 5th DCA 1993)). In an effort to dodge this requirement, the plaintiff cites Doe v. Celebrity 
Cruises, Inc., 394 F.3d 891, 917 (11th Cir. 2004), an admiralty case that has nothing to do with 
Chapter 800, let alone the basic premise (left unaddressed by the plaintiff) that "not every 
statutory violation carries a civil remedy." Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Plaza Materials Co,p., 
908 So. 2d 360, 374 (Fla. 2005) (citing Villazon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 843 So. 2d 
842, 852 (Fla. 2003)). 
In Celebrity Cruises, the Eleventh Circuit distinguished "sexual battery" from "sexual 
assault" under Florida law. Celebrity Cruises, 394 F.3d at 916-17. The court also cited with 
approval the dissenting opinion in Doe v. Evans, 814 So. 2d 370, 380 (Fla. 2002) (Wells, C.J., 
dissenting), where Florida Chief Justice Wells admonished against "the use of broad, indefinite, 
and legally nonspecific language" to establish causes of action under a rubric as expansive as 
"'sexual misconduct."' Evans, 814 So. 2d at 379-81 (Wells, C.J., dissenting). See also id. at 
379 (Wells, C.J., dissenting) (noting that "'sexual misconduct' is a phrase of inherent vagueness 
and has no meaning in Florida tort law," adding that "[t]orts have defined elements") ( emphasis 
added). 
Accordingly, this case serves only to highlight that Florida has never relaxed its 
pleading requirements simply because a plaintiff describes an event as a "sexual assault." To 
plead a legal cause of action, the plaintiff still must allege a real, recognized tort. 
In trying to obfuscate the basis for her civil-conspiracy claim, the plaintiff has only 
confirmed that she is relying on Chapter 800, a statute that does not afford a private right of 
action. Because the statute she expressly pleads provides no civil remedy, the plaintiff cannot 
prevail on her derivative claim for civil conspiracy.

2. The plaintiff has not asserted a cause of action against Robson for 
intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
The plaintiff says she agreed to perform an illegal massage "to make some extra money" 
(DE 11 at 7), only to "suffer severe mental anguish and pain" (DE 1-3 at 106) when her illegal 
scheme met with an allegedly superseding illegal scheme. To establish a cause of action for 
intentional infliction of emotional distress, however, it is not sufficient to allege that '"the 
defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that [the defendant] has 
intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that [the defendant's] conduct has been 
characterized by 'malice,' or a degree of aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive 
damages for another tort."' Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. McCarson, 467 So. 2d 277, 278 (Fla. 1985) 
(quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46 (1965)). Rather, "the conduct as a matter of law 
must be so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds 
of decency." Southland Corp. v. Bartsch, 522 So. 2d 1053, 1056 (Fla. 5th DCA 1988). Here, 
when it comes to Robson, the amended complaint fails to meet these standards. 5 
Indeed, the plaintiff does not allege that Robson c01mnitted an assault; or that Robson 
acted forcibly; or that Robson acted coercively. Further, the plaintiff says she undressed, and 
presumably remained in Epstein's home, out of "shock, fear, and trepidation" (DE 1-3 at 104), 
not because of anything allegedly done by Robson. These allegations, to the extent they have to 
do with Robson, do not allege anything that Robson did that is "so extreme in degree as to go 
beyond all possible bounds of decency." Bartsch, 522 So. 2d at 1056. 
The standard for detem1ining IIED "is a matter of law, not a question of fact." Ponton v. 
Scarfone, 468 So. 2d 1009, 1011 (Fla. 2d DCA 1985) (citation omitted). Even when alleged

This Response, in focusing only on fraudulent joinder, does not address the plaintiffs claims 
against the diverse defendants, Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen.

conduct is "condemnable by civilized social standards," it may still "not ascend, or perhaps 
descend, to a level permitting [a court] to say that the benchmarks enunciated [by the Florida 
Supreme Court] ... have been met." Id. 
Further, an IIED claim must be evaluated "as 
objectively as is possible" to detennine whether the conduct "is 'atrocious, and utterly intolerable 
in a civilized community."' Id. (quoting McCarson, 467 So. 2d at 278) ( emphasis added). 
When it comes to Robson, the plaintiff talks about being double-crossed. 
But 111 
emphasizing her own response to Robson's alleged deception (DE 1-3 at 104), and in explaining 
her decision to remain in the massage room (DE 1-3 at 103-04), the plaintiff ignores the basic 
principle that "the subjective response of the person who is the target of the actor's conduct does 
not control the question of whether the tort [of IIED] occurred." Bartsch, 522 So. 2d at 1056 
(citing Ponton, 468 So. 2d at 1011) (emphasis added). Here, the plaintiff alleges, at most, that 
Robson coordinated an openly illegal transaction with her (DE 1-3 at 103 ), but that Robson did 
not tell her everything that might happen while she was engaged in her illegal activities. This 
theory of liability, even in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, is far too attenuated to support 
an IIED claim. 
To start with, the plaintiff acknowledges that she intended "to give Epstein a massage for 
monetary compensation" (DE 1-3 at 103), even though she was unlicensed, untrained, and 
unqualified to perfonn this professional service; the plaintiff also acknowledges that she 
pretended to be 18 (DE 1 at 61). Apart from the fact that plaintiffs conduct is flatly proscribed 
by Florida's criminal code, see Fla. Stat. § 480.047, these allegations, when viewed "as 
objectively as is possible," simply do not implicate Robson, an alleged go-between for plaintiffs 
own criminality, in something "'atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community"' for

purposes of establishing an IIED claim. Ponton, 468 So.2d at 1011 (quoting McCarson, 467 So. 
2d at 278). 
Even if the plaintiff was "shock[ed]" (DE 1-3 at 104) to learn that Robson had engineered 
some sort of misdirection, that is still not enough to support an IIED claim against Robson. 
Again, it is not "' enough that the defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even 
criminal, or that [the defendant] has intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that [the 
defendant's] conduct has been characterized by 'malice,' or a degree of aggravation which would 
entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort."' McCarson, 467 So. 2d at 278 (quoting 
Restatement (Second) of Torts§ 46 (1965)). 
Here, the amended complaint does not allege that Robson knew an alleged assault 
would take place; besides which, the plaintiff says she was assaulted by someone else (DE 1-3 at 
104--05). See Baker v. Fitzgerald, 573 So. 2d 873, 873 (Fla. 3d DCA 1990) (per curiam) 
("Appellant's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress fails because there was no 
showing of outrageous conduct directed at the appellant herself.") ( emphasis added). Further, 
there is nothing in the record to suggest that Robson knew the plaintiff would remove her 
clothing, or stay in the massage room, out of "shock, fear and trepidation" (DE 1-3 at 104), when 
the plaintiff was never coerced, by Robson, to do anything. Cf Habelow v. Travelers Ins. Co., 
389 So. 2d 218, 220 (Fla. 5th DCA 1980) (affirming dismissal of claim for intentional infliction 
of emotional distress where there were "no allegations ... indicating that [the plaintiff] was 
particularly sensitive or susceptible to emotional distress, or that [the defendant] had any basis to 
know she was" (citing Steiner & Munach, P. A. v. Williams, 334 So. 2d 39 (Fla. 3d DCA 
1976))).

CASE NO.: 08-80804-CN-MARRA/JOHNSON 
For these reasons, the plaintiff has not stated a cause of action against Robson for 
intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
3. The plaintiff has not asserted a cause of action against Robson for civil 
RICO. 
The plaintiff, again substih1ting superficially framed legal standards for actual analysis, 
says she "was directly harmed by the [defendants'] scheme." (DE 11 at 9.) This bare assertion 
completely ignores the RICO discussion presented in the removal petition (DE 1 at 19-21), but 
more important, refuses to acknowledge that section 772.104 allows someone to bring a civil 
RICO claim only if "she has been injured by reason of" any RICO violation. § 772.104, Fla. 
Stat. (2007) ( emphasis added). 
Here, the plaintiff clearly alleges that she was injured as a result of "a sexual assault ... 
in violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes" (DE 1-3 at 105), a statute that has nothing to 
do with, and does not constitute a predicate act in furtherance of, Florida RICO. 
Cf § 
772.104, Fla. Stat. (listing predicate acts for Florida RICO). The plaintiff hardly establishes a 
RICO claim merely by reciting that she "was a victim of Defendants' scheme because she was 
one of the underage girls found and delivered to Defendant Epstein by Defendant Robson and 
that she endured Epstein's actions as he tried to get her to engage in, and forced upon her, acts of 
prostih1tion and lewdness." (DE 11 at 9.) Not just in this passage, but indeed throughout her 
entire amended complaint, the plaintiff uses the term "scheme" as though it were a password for 
gaining access to RICO standing. Cf Newton v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 207 F.3d 444, 447 (8th Cir. 
2000) (observing in the context of indirect and attenuated RICO allegations that "[t]he mere 
recitation of the chain of causation alleged by the plaintiffs is perhaps the best explanation of 
why they do not have standing in this case").

CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
In sum, the plaintiff has said nothing to rebut what remains obvious: that her entire 
lawsuit, including her RlCO claim, rests on an alleged "sexual assault ... in violation of Chapter 
800 of the Florida Statutes." (DE 1-3 at 105.) Thus, the plaintiff has failed to allege a cause of 
action against Haley Robson. See Baisch v. Gallina, 346 F.3d 366, 373 (2d Cir. 2003) ("[A] 
plaintiff does not have standing if [s]he suffered an injury that was indirectly (and hence not 
proximately) caused by the racketeering activity or RlCO predicate acts, even though the injury 
was proximately caused by some non-RICO violations committed by the defendants.") 
(emphasis added); Hoatson v. New York Archdiocese, No. 05 Civ. 10467, 2007 WL 431098, at 
*12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2007) (dismissing RlCO claim with prejudice where amended complaint 
was "wholly devoid of a single act which constitutes a racketeering activity," even though the 
plaintiff had '"alleged a larger picture"' involving, among other things, allegations of sexual 
abuse) (emphasis added). 
By re-writing Florida's RlCO statute to encompass Chapter 800, the plaintiff once again 
seeks (hypothetical) damages against Haley Robson without any statutory basis. This tactic, 
besides being ineffectual to prevent removal, flouts the fact that "the RlCO statute is complex, 
arcane, and difficult to plead." Id. 
Cf id. at **12-16 (imposing sanctions in response to 
baseless RICO claim brought against the backdrop of sexual-abuse allegations, observing that 
"[t]he immediate link between the filing of the complaint and the press conference [held by the 
plaintiffs counsel] support[ s] the inference that [ there was an] intent[] . . . to injure [ the 
defendants' reputation by bringing a RlCO claim]").

CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Although asserting a RICO claim may be part of the plaintiffs media strategy,6 it is 
without legal merit and cannot operate to prevent removal. 
Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, and the plaintiffs failure to address, let alone rebut, the 
fraudulent-joinder arguments presented in the removal petition, neither remand nor attorneys' 
fees are warranted in this case.
