EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO STAY DISCLOSURE OF THE NON-
PROSECUTION AGREEMENT AND ADDENDUM PENDING REVIEW 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned 
counsel and pursuant to Rule 9.310, Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure, moves to stay 
disclosure of the Non-Prosecution Agreement and Addendum (collectively, the "NPA") 
pending review, and states: 
• 1. 
In the event the Court grants Non party -
Motion to Vacate Order 
Sealing Records and Unseal Records, grants Palm Beach Post's Motion to Intervene and 
Petition for Access and/or denies EPSTEIN's Motion to Make Court Records 
Confidential, EPSTEIN moves to stay the disclosure of the NP A pending review by the 
Fourth District Court of Appeals. 
2. 
Rule 9.310(a), Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure, provides in pertinent 
part, " ... a party seeking to stay a final or non-fmal order pending review shall file a 
motion in the lower tribunal, which shall have continuing jurisdiction, in its discretion , to 
grant, modify or deny such relief."

3. 
A stay pending review is warranted under the circumstances because of 
the irreparable harm that would be caused by disclosure of the NP A including, but not 
limited to, substantial injury to a party by disclosing matters protected by common ,law 
and privacy rights, substantial injury to a compelling government interest, substantial 
injury to innocent third parties and a serious imminent threat to the fair, impartial and 
orderly administration of justice as set forth in the hearing record date June 25, 2009. 
4. 
In Mariner Health Care of Nashville, Inc. v. Baker, 739 So. 2d 608, 609 
(Fla. 1st DCA 1999), defendant Mariner filed a petition for writ of certiorari after the trial 
court compelled it to produce certain incident reports. Mariner also moved for a stay 
pending review pursuant to Fla. R. App. Pro. 9.310. The trial court advised the parties 
that Mariner would be required to submit the incident reports to the court under seal as a 
prerequisite to a stay. Mariner refused to produce the documents under seal and the trial 
court denied the motion for stay and imposed daily fines until the documents were 
produced. Id. The First District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's order and 
noted 
Id. at 610. 
Mariner has failed to explain how the production of the 
reports under seal would result in any prejudice. To the 
contrary, the records will be protected from disclosure 
during the entire course of the certiorari proceeding before 
this court. No harm can be done if this court ultimately 
determines that the reports are protected by the work 
product privilege. 
5. 
In the instant case the NP A is already filed under seal. Should the Court 
grant Nonparty- Motion to Vacate Order Sealing Records and Unseal Records, 
grant Palm Beach Post's Motion to Intervene and Petition for Access and/or deny

:,..,; 
EPSTEIN's .Motion to Make Court Records Confidential, EPSTEIN requests the Court 
exercise its discretion under Fla. R. App. Pro. 9.310(a) and enter a stay pending review 
by the 4th DCA. 
6. 
No harm will be done if the NPA remains under seal pending appellate 
review. To the contrary, EPSTEIN will suffer irreparable harm if a stay is not entered 
and the NP A is disclosed to the public. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, respectfully requests that if the 
Court grants Nonparty -
Motion to Vacate Order Sealing Records and Unseal 
Records, grants Palm Beach Post's Motion to Intervene and Petition for Access and/or 
denies EPSTEIN's Motion to Make Court Records Confidential, the Court enter a stay 
• pending review and grant any additional relief the Court deems just and proper.
