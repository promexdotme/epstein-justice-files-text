Dear Mr. Leopold: 
Yesterday's fax from you is more of the same misrepresentation of the record and self-
serving grandstanding that you engaged in throughout Wednesday's deposition. Anyone 
who reads the transcript will see the desperate tactics you used. You had no standing to 
object on any basis other than privilege. Despite that, you made improper speaking 
objections, mischaracterized the record and coached your client's answers. Ms. 
deposition proves beyond any doubt that the intervenor's complaint that you 
filed against Mr. Epstein for $50,000,000.00 [sic] is frivolous and violates FED. R. Civ. P. 
11. Beyond your stunts and meritless allegations, you clearly lied to us about your 
availability for the deposition, necessitating Mr. Goldberger's changing his vacation 
plans. 
Finally, your letter, like your reckless and libelous accusations, is nonsense. The 
deposition exhibits — including the photos that your client posted on the Internet of 
herself in various states of undress simulating intercourse, fellatio and violent gang rape —
were numerically stamped and bar-coded. You well know that we provided the court 
reporter with color copies, which will be attached to the deposition transcript. You also 
know that both you and Ms. Belohlavek agreed to that procedure before you left the 
deposition room. If you have any question about the authenticity of the photographs 
when you receive the exhibits, you can ask your client about the evidence she destroyed 
last week after she was already under subpoena. 
I hope that in the future you can comport yourself within the bounds of professionalism. 
Very truly y s, 
MichaellR. Tein

Probable Cause Affidavit 
Palm Beach Police Department 
Agency ORI# FLO 500600 
Police Case#: 05-368 
Defendant: Jeffrey Epstein 
Race/Sex: White Male 
DOB: 	
01-20-1953 
Charges: 	
Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor (2) counts 
Lewd and Lascivious Molestation 
On 03/15/2005, A fourteen year old white female, hereinafter referred to as "The Victim", and her family 
reported unlawful sexual activity which occurred at a residence within the Town of Palm Beach. The victim 
reported that a subject known to her as "Jeff" had touched her vagina area with a vibrator/massager while within 
his residence. 
During a sworn taped interview, the victim admitted to knowing that W/F, Haley Robson worked for a wealthy 
man and possibly did sexual favors for him. She also admitted that Robson had offered her an opportunity to 
make money. The victim identified Robson's boss as a white male named "Jeff who lived in Palm Beach (Later 
positively identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up). During the beginning of February 2005, the 
victim explained that she was first approached by Robson to go with her to Jeff s house. The victim stated 
Robson said that she would pick her up at the victims house on Sunday. The victim was not sure of the exact 
dates but knew it was a Sunday. According to the victim, Robson along with a Hispanic female, later identified 
as 
picked her up at her father's house. The victim told her father that they were going shopping. It was 
later confirmed by the victim's father that Robson picked his daughter up on February 6, 2005. According to 
the victim's father, Robson drove a pick up truck. Robson drove the victim to Palm Beach. Sometime on the 
way there, a conversation occurred between Robson and the victim whereas Robson reportedly told the victim 
that if Jeff asked her (the victim) age, she should say she was eighteen. The victim recalled that Jeffs house was 
on a dead end street. The victim described Jeffs house as a two story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade 
parked in the driveway. The girls walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. 
In fact, the victim recalled a male approaching them asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to 
see Jeff. The male allowed them to continue walking up to the house. The victim stated the man told them that 
Jeff was not there but was expected back. He allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them 
something to drink while they waited inside. Shortly after, Jeff and a woman, described as white with blond hair 
entered the kitchen. 
The foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed 
before me this 23 day of November, 2005 by 
Det Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.

The victim believed the woman was Jeffs assistant. The victim added that the woman did not seem friendly and 
kept her responses short and direct. Jeff introduced himself to the victim. The victim described Jeff as being 
approximately forty-five years old, a long face, and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair. 
Robson and Jeff left the kitchen leaving the victim alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. They 
all spoke briefly in the kitchen. The victim stated the woman instructed her to follow her upstairs, which she did. 
The victim recalled walking up a flight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room. Upon entering the room there 
was a large bathroom to the right. The victim recalled a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door 
on each side of the sofa. The victim recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as 
several photographs of naked women on a shelf. According to the victim, the woman led her to a room that had 
a massage table in it. The woman started to fix up the room, putting the covers on the table and taking lotions 
out. She then told the victim that Jeff would be up in a second. 
The woman left the room, and soon after, Jeff walked in wearing only a towel and told the victim to take off her 
clothes. The victim stated he was stern when he told her to take off her clothes. The victim said she did not 
know what to do as she was the only one there in the room. The victim took off her shirt leaving her bra on. 
Jeff, had removed his towel and told the victim to take off everything . The victim stated Jeff was nude when 
he took his towel off, placing it on the floor as he laid down on the table. The victim stated she removed her 
pants leaving her thong panties on. Jeff then instructed her to give him a massage pointing to a specific lotion for 
her to use. As the victim began to give Jeff the massage, he told her to get on his back. The victim stated she 
straddled herself on Jeff s back. The victim stated her exposed buttocks were touching Jeff's bare buttocks. 
The victim said Jeff was specific in his instruction to her on how to massage, telling her to go clockwise or 
counter clockwise. Jeff then turned over and instructed the victim, to massage his chest. The victim resumed 
massaging his chest area. The victim was now standing on the ground. Jeff turned to his side, started to rub his 
penis in an up and down motion. The victim stated Jeff held on to the small of her back as she massaged his

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I responded to the address of Robson and viewed her vehicle parked in the 
driveway. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were 
investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she would 
accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the 
interview she would be returned home. 
Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I 
explained to Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to 
leave at any time she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson 
stated she understood. During the taped sworn interview Robson was asked how she became in contact with 
Epstein. Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend "Molly" in the 
Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she 
would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to 
meet with Jeffrey. 
Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked her up and she was taken to Epstein's 
house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also 
introduced to a white female known to her as Sara. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as 
Jeff Epstein's bedroom . Sara arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She brought out 
the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sara, then left the room and informed her Jeff would be 
in, in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel and laid nude on the 
massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him. 
During the massage, Robson stated "He tried to touch me and I stopped him." I asked how did he tried to 
touch her. He grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator 
which is large and white in color. Robson told Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched. 
Robson stated she performed the massage naked. 
At the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.00 for the massage. He explained, I know you're 
not comfortable, but I'll pay you if you bring some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she 
once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson was asked how 
many girls did she bring in total to Epstein. Robson stated six that she can remember. Robson stated she had 
brought the following girls: the victim, 
 , 
(16 female), 
(16 female),
and at the time they were brought to Epstein's house, all the girls were 14 through 16 years of age.

I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised the victim was the youngest as she was fourteen 
when the massage occurred. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when they arrived. 
They were told they would provide a massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked her if the 
victim was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew the victim 
wanted to make money . She approached the victim and explained about going to work for Jeff. The victim 
agreed and arrangements were made to bring the victim to Epstein's house on a weekend. Robson stated that 
she and 	
(Later identified as

Epsteins House and entered through the kitchen door. They met with the house chef and Epstein's assistant 
Sara. The victim was introduced to Epstein while they were in the kitchen area. Sara led the victim upstairs and 
Epstein went upstairs. When the massage was over, the victim returned to the kitchen area. Robson stated she 
was paid $200.00 for bringing the victim to Epstein's house. Robson stated the victim told her she was paid 
$300.00 for the massage. 
Robson stated the victim was the last person she brought to Epstein's house . She further stated that she had 
changed her cellular number to avoid being contacted by Sarah. Robson stated Sarah (Later identified as Sarah 
Kellen) is Epstein's personal assistant. She continued stating that she had no direct contact with Epstein when 
he was going to travel to Palm Beach. Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that he is 
traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to "work" for Epstein. 
Robson stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters 
with him and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sarah still tries to call Robson's house and leaves 
messages. 
Sgt Frick entered the room and explained that based on her own statements, she had implicated herself by 
bringing underage girls to Epstein's house. Robson provided cellular telephone numbers for the girls she had 
mentioned previously. Additionally, she also provided possible addresses and areas in which they lived. As 
Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record any 
conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment " I'm like a 
Heidi Fliess". (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was 
dropped off at her house without incident.

touch her. He grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator 
which is large and white in color. Robson told Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched.

While in the home, I observed the pink and green couch within the master bedroom area just as the girls 
previously mentioned. The stair way which is located from the kitchen area to the master bedroom area is lined 
with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked young females were obtained 
as they appeared to be photographs of the girls that had been at the house to provide massages. Various phone 
message books were also taken in which his assistant had left messages for Epstein as to which girls were coming 
to provide massages. 
During the course of the investigation, It was determined that Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant made the 
arrangements to have girls come and "work" for Epstein. Kellen was aware of various ages of girls as she had 
maintained contact with the girls that had been previously at the house. Additionally, there were various phone 
messages left for Epstein by Kellen in which the message had made references such as "the girls would have to 
come after they are released from school". 
Based on the facts, there is sufficient probable cause to charge Sarah Kellen for Principal in the 1" degree for 
Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor 2 counts a second degree felony in direct violation of Florida State Statues 
794.05(1) as she orchestrated the arrangement with Epstein and the masseuses in which Epstein had vaginal 
intercourse with 	
and 
It should be noted that both girls were minors when this occurred. There is 
sufficient probable cause to charge Sarah Kellen with Principal in the 1' degree for Lewd and Lascivious 
Molestation (The Victim), a second degree felony in direct violation of Florida State Statues 800.04 (5) as Sarah 
Kellen orchestrated the initial contact with the victim who was only 14 years of age when Epstein performed the 
molestation with the vibrator on her vagina area.

You are nice, trendy, and love to 
have fun! 
Heroes 
You are Marilyn Monroe, an arche-
type and an enigma. You represent 
all that it means to be sexy, but 
sometimes your true self gets lost 
Embrace your beauty and yourself, 
and you are a force that must be 
reckoned with. You are woman. 
You're Marilyn Monroe! 
What Classic Pin-Up Are You? 
brought to you by Quizilla My heroes 
— are my parents and my brother<3 
I also admire Madonna and Paris 
Hilton***Their both hot girls with 
cool ass 
they do what they 
want and could care less what 
everyone else thinks of them**

Who I'd like to meet: 
Wove' 
DON'T CL 
TIM 
Anyone who wants to meet me ...Hi 
everyone) 
www.myspace.com/onehotgirl  
with my girls... Take the 
quiz: "What kind of eyes do 
you have? (with pictures)" 
Eden 
You have eden eyes. Eden 
is the color of water. Your 
eyes symbolize your great 
flexibility. You are a 
creative person. You can 
think of many good ways 
to get your point across to 
people as you have very 
good communication 
abilities. When someone 
feels down or is hurt, you 
have the remarkable ability 
to help them and heal 
them. If you have too little 
going on in your life, you 
may be withdrawn and 
depressed, timid, 
manipulative, unreliable, 
stubborn, or suspicious. 
Some words to describe 
you: peaceful, sincere, 
affectionate, tranquil, 
intuitive, trustworthy, 
pure, loyal, healing, and 
stable. Take the 
quiz: "Which Victoria's 
Secret Angel are you?"
