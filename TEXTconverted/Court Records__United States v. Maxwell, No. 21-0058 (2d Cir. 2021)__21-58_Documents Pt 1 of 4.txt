7 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

10 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
Case 21-58, Document 1-2, 01/12/2021, 3011673, Page5 of 19

advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

16 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

28 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
37 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
Case 21-58, Document 1-2, 01/12/2021, 3011673, Page9 of 19

this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see

80 LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from
AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
81 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

docket by that date. The Court will take no action on the request pending resolution of

92 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

95 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three−part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.

thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the

And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine

Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
Case 21-58, Document 1-2, 01/12/2021, 3011673, Page17 of 19

motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to

transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

ORDER 
 
 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 
On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed motion for release 
on bail.  Dkt No. 97.  In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court 
DENIES the Defendant’s motion. 
In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that 
should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose 
any redactions to the Court’s Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by reference to 
the Second Circuit’s decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 
2006). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, 
the Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.   
This Order provides the bottom line of the Court’s resolution.  On July 14, 2020, this 
Court conducted an extensive bail hearing and determined that pre-trial detention was warranted 
because the no conditions or set of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s 
appearance at future proceedings.  Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f), a bail hearing may be reopened if 
the Court finds “that information exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the 
hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that 
will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required.”  The Court concludes that

none of the new information that the Defendant presented in support of her application has a 
material bearing on the Court’s determination that she poses a flight risk.   
Furthermore, for substantially the same reasons as the Court determined that detention 
was warranted in the initial bail hearing, the Court again concludes that no conditions of release 
can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.  In reaching that 
conclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight 
of the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the 
nature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose.  See 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(g).  The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the 
community.  Nonetheless the Court determines that the other three factors warrant detention 
under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e).  The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions 
would not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.   
As a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion 
that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pre-trial detention continues to be warranted. 
On or before December 30, 2020, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter 
indicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such proposal. 
This resolves Dkt No. 97. 
SO ORDERED. 
Dated: December 28, 2020

7 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

10 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
Case 21-58, Document 3-2, 01/12/2021, 3011691, Page6 of 20

advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

16 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public

28 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
37 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
Case 21-58, Document 3-2, 01/12/2021, 3011691, Page10 of 20

this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

73 MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 60 Letter filed by USA as
to Ghislaine Maxwell re: The Government respectfully requests that the Court approve
the Government's request to delay disclosure of these
Materials...ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the
Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see
Dkt. No. 36. (Government Responses due by 3/12/2021) (Signed by Judge Alison J.

80 LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from
AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
81 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

sealed (or redacted). Alternatively, the Defendant may file the letter on the public
docket by that date. The Court will take no action on the request pending resolution of

92 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The

And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine

Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
Case 21-58, Document 3-2, 01/12/2021, 3011691, Page18 of 20

motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to
transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

7 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

10 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
Case 21-58, Document 20-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page5 of 24

capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

16 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

28 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
37 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
Case 21-58, Document 20-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page9 of 24

statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

Materials...ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the
Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see

AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
81 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

92 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law
presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations
against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing factors include
but are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency'
and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United
States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d Cir.1995) ("Amodeo II")). The proposed
redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's letter motions are
"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'
thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the
Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995).
And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

99 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 16, 2020, the Government filed its
opposition to Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's renewed application for bail. In
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89, the
Government filed its materials under seal and proposed narrowly tailored redactions on
Case 21-58, Document 20-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page16 of 24

those materials. The Defendant did not file any opposition to the Government's
proposed redactions. The Court will adopt the Government's proposed redactions after
applying the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i)
determine whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the
weight of the common law presumption access to the materials; and (iii) balance
competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such
countervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law
enforcement or judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting
disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo II"), 71 F.3d
1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995)). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds
that the Governments submissions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial
function and useful in the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial
document" for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v.
Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). And the Court also finds that
the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at 146; see also Nixon v. Warner
Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978). Nevertheless, the proposed redactions are
narrowly tailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third
parties' personal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460
467 (S.D.N.Y.2017). The Government is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits by no later than December 18, 2 (Signed by

101 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 18, 2020, the Defendant filed her
reply to the Government's opposition to her renewed application for bail. In
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89, she filed these

redactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrowly

personal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460, 467

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and
Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
Case 21-58, Document 20-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page17 of 24

motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to
transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

03/18/2021
168 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15−cv−7433, Dkt. No. 1212−1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant
portions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket
on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file
a letter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding
pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The
parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the
Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March
22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions
to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 22, 2021 (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 3/18/21)(jw) (Entered: 03/18/2021)

confer and propose and justify any redactions to the Defendant's reply brief by March
24, 2021. If they conclude that redactions are unnecessary, the Defendant is
ORDERED to docket the unredacted version of the brief by March 24, 2021. (Signed

171 REPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW in Support as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 160
THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)
03/24/2021
172 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter
from the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose
personal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm
shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that letter, the law firm
also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims
it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,
even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial
briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall
enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.
Ray, No. 20−CR−110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020)
("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential
information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the
victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court
will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds
that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the
law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer
with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the
objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or
before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing
of objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm
may reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order).
Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/24/2021)(bw) (Entered:

7 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
Case 21-58, Document 21-2, 03/24/2021, 3065978, Page6 of 25

capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

16 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

28 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
37 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
Case 21-58, Document 21-2, 03/24/2021, 3065978, Page10 of 25

statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

Materials...ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the
Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see

AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
81 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

92 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

95 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three−part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in
question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law
presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations
against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing factors include
but are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency'
and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United
States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d Cir.1995) ("Amodeo II")). The proposed
redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's letter motions are
"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'
thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the
Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995).
And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

99 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 16, 2020, the Government filed its
opposition to Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's renewed application for bail. In
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89, the
Government filed its materials under seal and proposed narrowly tailored redactions on
Case 21-58, Document 21-2, 03/24/2021, 3065978, Page17 of 25

those materials. The Defendant did not file any opposition to the Government's
proposed redactions. The Court will adopt the Government's proposed redactions after
applying the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i)
determine whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the
weight of the common law presumption access to the materials; and (iii) balance
competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such
countervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law
enforcement or judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting
disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo II"), 71 F.3d
1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995)). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds
that the Governments submissions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial
function and useful in the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial
document" for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v.
Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). And the Court also finds that
the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at 146; see also Nixon v. Warner
Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978). Nevertheless, the proposed redactions are
narrowly tailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third
parties' personal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460
467 (S.D.N.Y.2017). The Government is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits by no later than December 18, 2 (Signed by
Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/18/2020) (ap) (Entered: 12/18/2020)

101 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 18, 2020, the Defendant filed her
reply to the Government's opposition to her renewed application for bail. In
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89, she filed these
materials under seal and proposed narrowly tailored redactions on those materials. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three−part test
articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d
110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the

And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978). As with the
redactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrowly
tailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties
personal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460, 467
(S.D.N.Y. 2017). See also Dkt. No. 95. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket
the redacted documents and corresponding exhibits by no later than December 23,
2020. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/23/2020) (lnl)

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and
Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
Case 21-58, Document 21-2, 03/24/2021, 3065978, Page18 of 25

motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to
transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

168 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15−cv−7433, Dkt. No. 1212−1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant
portions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket
on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file
a letter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding
pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The
parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the
Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March
22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions
to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 22, 2021 (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 3/18/21)(jw) (Entered: 03/18/2021)

24, 2021. If they conclude that redactions are unnecessary, the Defendant is
ORDERED to docket the unredacted version of the brief by March 24, 2021. (Signed

THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)
03/24/2021
172 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter
from the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose
personal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm
shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that letter, the law firm
also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims
it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,
even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial
briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall
enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.
Ray, No. 20−CR−110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020)
("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential
information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the
victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court
will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds
that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the
law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer
with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the
objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or
before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing
of objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm
may reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order).
Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/24/2021)(bw) (Entered:

7 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

10 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
Case 21-58, Document 23, 03/29/2021, 3065988, Page5 of 24

capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

16 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

28 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
37 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
Case 21-58, Document 23, 03/29/2021, 3065988, Page9 of 24

statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

to Ghislaine Maxwell re: The Government respectfully requests that the Court approve
the Government's request to delay disclosure of these
Materials...ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the
Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see

AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
81 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

On or before December 2, 2020, Defendant shall justify why this letter should be
sealed (or redacted). Alternatively, the Defendant may file the letter on the public
docket by that date. The Court will take no action on the request pending resolution of
the initial sealing question. The Defendant's letter and this memorandum endorsement

92 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the

corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978). As with the
redactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrowly
tailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties
personal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460, 467
(S.D.N.Y. 2017). See also Dkt. No. 95. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and
Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
Case 21-58, Document 23, 03/29/2021, 3065988, Page17 of 24

motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to
transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

168 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15−cv−7433, Dkt. No. 1212−1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant
portions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket
on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file
a letter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding
pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The
parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the
Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March
22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions
to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 22, 2021 (Signed by Judge

171 REPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW in Support as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 160
THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)
03/24/2021
172 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter
from the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose
personal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm
shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that letter, the law firm
also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims
it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,
even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial
briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall
enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.
Ray, No. 20−CR−110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020)
("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential
information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the
victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court
will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds
that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the
law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer
with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the
objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or
before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing
of objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm
may reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order).
Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/24/2021)(bw) (Entered:
