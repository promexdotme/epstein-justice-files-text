UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 09-CIV• 80469 - MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE II, 
Plaintiff, 
V. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
_____________ / 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S UNOPPOSED MOTION TO EXCEED PAGE 
LIMITATION FOR DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS & SUPPORTING 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW DIRECTED TO PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his undersigned counsel, moves 
to exceed the page limitation of 20 pages imposed by Loe. Gen. Rule 7.1. C. 2. (S.D. 
Fla.), in his memorandum of law in support of his motion to dismiss directed to Plaintiff 
JANE DOE ll's Complaint [DE 1], filed March 25, 2009. 
In support of his motion, 
Defendant states: 
1. Local Gen. Rule 7.1 C. 2. provides in part that absent prior permission of the 
court, no party shall file any legal memorandum exceeding 20 pages in length. 
Defendant is in the process of preparing his motion to dismiss and supporting 
memorandum of law directed to Plaintiffs Complaint, (which is due by an extension to 
May 6, 2009), and the legal memorandum will exceed the 20 page limitation. It is clear 
based on the issues raised in Plaintiff's Complaint that in excess of 20 pages is required 
to fully and adequately discuss the issues raised in moving to dismiss Plaintiff's action. 
2. The issues being addressed include but are not limited to constitutional law 
issues and what version of 18 U.S.C.A. §2255 applies to this action, and the meaning of 
§2255 with respect to the cause of action created and the presumptive minimum

damages amount imposed. (It is Defendant's position that the 2006 amended version 
does NOT apply to this action; rather, it is the statute in effect during the time of the 
alleged conduct that apply). 
3. Plaintiff's Complaint seeks to multiple the presumptive minimum damages 
amount under 18 U.S.C. §2255 and references the 2006 amended version of the 
statute, which most significantly increased triple-fold the presumptive minimum 
damages amount imposed from $50,000 to $150,000. 
4. A length exceeding 20 pages is required so that Defendant may fully address the 
issues raised in Plaintiff's Complaint and in seeking dismissal thereof. 
Under the 
constitutional guarantees of due process, including a fair and full opportunity to be 
heard, and in the interests of justice so that the Court may render a fully informed 
decision on the issue, Defendant is entitled to an order granting his motion to exceed 
the page limitation. 
(Excluding endnotes, quoting statutory text and Complaint 
allegations, it appears that Defendant's legal memorandum will be approximately 24 to 
28 pages.) 
5. As certified below herein, Plaintiff's counsel agreed to the request to exceed 20 
pages. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court grant Defendant's 
motion, and enter an order allowing Defendant's legal memorandum in support of 
dismissal of Plaintiff's action to be in excess of 20 pages.
