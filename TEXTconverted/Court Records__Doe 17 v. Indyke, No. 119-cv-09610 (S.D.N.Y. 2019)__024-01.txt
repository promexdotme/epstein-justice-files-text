MOTION TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY ON BEHALF OF JANE DOE 17 
AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
 
 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe 17, herein files her Motion to Proceed Anonymously and Supporting 
Memorandum of Law and in support thereof states: 
I. 
PLAINTIFF IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY IN THIS 
CIRCUIT. 
 
This action involves Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual assault of Plaintiff (“Plaintiff”) in violation 
of the New York Law and/or the Trafficking Victims Protection Act under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591 
through 1595. Plaintiff submits this Memorandum of Law in support of Plaintiff’s Motion for 
Leave to Proceed Anonymously. Allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously will protect her 
highly sensitive personal information that will remain the focus of this litigation. There is no 
prejudice to Defendants in allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously, nor is there any significant 
public interest in the disclosure of the Plaintiff’s identity. In fact, the public interest in this case 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 1 of 13

Page 2 of 7 
 
weighs in favor of granting Plaintiff’s request to proceed anonymously for her protection. 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a) requires a Complaint to “include the names of all 
the parties.” However, the court has discretion to allow a plaintiff to proceed anonymously. 
Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 190 (2d. Cir. 2008). “[C]ourts have granted 
anonymity to protect against disclosure of a wide range of issues involving matters of the utmost 
intimacy, including sexual assault.” Doe. No. 2 v. Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193, 196 (EDNY 2006); see 
also 1991 McKinney’s Sessions Laws of N.Y. at 2211-2212 (“sexual assault victims have 
unfortunately had to endure a terrible invasion of their physical privacy. They have a right to 
expect that this violation will not be compounded by a further invasion of their privacy”). 
“When determining whether a plaintiff may be allowed to maintain an action under a 
pseudonym, the plaintiff’s interest in anonymity must be balanced against both the public 
interest in disclosure and any prejudice to the defendant.” Id. at 189. The balancing of interests 
entails the consideration of ten non-exhaustive factors, though the court has discretion to 
consider “other factors relevant to the particular case under consideration.” Id. at 189-190. The 
ten factors are: 
(1) whether the litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a 
personal nature; (2) whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or 
mental harm to the party seeking to proceed anonymously or even more 
critically, to innocent non-parties; (3) whether identification presents other harms 
and the likely severity of those harms, including whether the injury litigated 
against would be incurred as a result of the disclosure of the plaintiff’s identity; 
(4) whether the plaintiff is particularly vulnerable to the possible harms of 
disclosure, particularly in light of [her] age; (5) whether the suit is challenging 
the actions of the government or that of private parties; (6) whether the defendant 
is prejudiced by allowing the plaintiff to press [her] claims anonymously, 
whether the nature of that prejudice (if any) differs at any particular stage of the 
litigation, and whether any prejudice can be mitigated by the district court; (7) 
whether the plaintiff’s identity has thus far been kept confidential; (8) whether 
the public’s interest in the litigation is furthered by requiring the plaintiff to 
disclose his identity; (9) whether, because of the purely legal nature of the issues 
presented or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public interest in knowing the 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 2 of 13

Page 3 of 7 
 
litigants’ identities; and (10) whether there are any alternative mechanisms for 
protecting the confidentiality of the plaintiff. 
 
Id. at 190 (internal citations and quotations omitted). 
II. 
ALL TEN ANONYMITY FACTORS WEIGH IN FAVOR OF 
PERMITTING PLAINTIFF TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY. 
 
In this case, all delineated Sealed Plaintiff factors support Plaintiff’s application for 
anonymity, which should be granted for her protection. Plaintiff is a victim of multiple instances 
of sexual assault. The acts that were committed against Plaintiff are highly sensitive in nature 
and are particularly difficult for her to address in a public forum. 
For those reasons, among many others (some of which, if revealed in a public filing might 
disclose Plaintiff’s identity), identification of Plaintiff in this matter may pose a risk of 
retaliation. See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190.  In order to warrant anonymity, the possible 
retaliatory harm may be either physical or psychological in nature. See Doe v. Del Rio, 241 
F.R.D. 154, 158 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) Epstein’s vast wealth and far reaching connections make it 
clear that retaliation could be employed against individuals pursuing claims against the Estate 
of Jeffrey Epstein. In addition to exposing Plaintiff to physical or psychological harm, retaliation 
could also silence potential witnesses from coming forward. 
The public exposure of Plaintiff’s identity would certainly cause her to suffer additional 
or exacerbated emotional or psychological harm including shame, embarrassment, depression, 
anxiety, and the array of side effects that go along therewith. Should Plaintiff’s real identity be 
revealed, her safety could also be at risk as the media and the press worldwide are currently laser 
focused on Jeffrey Epstein and his sexually exploitative escapades. 
Despite the fact that Defendants are private parties and not Government entities, 
Defendants are not “ordinary” private parties because of Epstein’s known wealth, power, and 
reputation. See Kolko, 242 F.R.D. at 195 (2006). Jeffrey Epstein has been a known sexual 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 3 of 13

Page 4 of 7 
 
predator with substantial financial influence for many years. For years before his death, Epstein 
had been investigated by various state prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
for his sexual assaults on young girls. 
Given Epstein’s notoriety, Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual abuse and the widespread 
concealment of the same “raise concerns affecting a larger association rather than the interest of 
an individual plaintiff.” See id. at 195. In this case, the “larger association” is society in general. 
Society has an interest in eradicating the predatory practices of powerful men against vulnerable, 
susceptible women— including the practice of luring young girls for sexual purposes. This case 
is therefore more “analogous to one involving a government defendant, where personal 
anonymity is more readily granted because of the existence of a public interest in the action.” EW 
v. New York Blood Center, 213 F.R.D. 108, 112 (EDNY 2003). 
“The public right to scrutinize governmental functioning is not so completely impaired 
by a grant of anonymity to a party as it is by closure of the trial itself . . . Party anonymity does 
not obstruct the public’s view of the issues joined or the court’s performance in resolving them.” 
See Doe v. Stegall¸ 653 F.2d 180, 185 (5th Cir. 1981). The public’s interest in this legal question 
is not furthered by requiring Plaintiff to disclose her identity. See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 
190 (citing Del Rio, 241 F.R.D. at 154 (“whether, because of the purely legal nature of the issues 
presented or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public interest in knowing the litigants’ 
identities”)); see also Free Speech v. Reno, Case No. 98 Civ. 2680 MBM, 1999 WL 47310 at *3 
(SDNY Feb. 1, 1999) (“because the particular plaintiffs in this constitutional challenge are 
essentially interchangeable with similarly situated persons, there appears little public interest in 
which particular persons have actually sued…”). Because Plaintiff’s anonymity would not 
impair the public’s right to view or scrutinize this lawsuit, this factor weighs in favor of 
nondisclosure. Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting the identities of 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 4 of 13

Page 5 of 7 
 
sexual assault victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.” 
Kolko, 242 F.R.D. at 195. 
Finally, [t]he Second Circuit directed district courts to evaluate “whether there are any 
alternative mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of the plaintiff.” Sealed Plaintiff, 537 
F.3d at 190 (citing Roe v. Aware Woman Center for Choice, Inc., 253 F.3d 678, 687 (11th Cir. 
2001)): 
The only justification the defendants offer for stripping Roe of her privacy is the 
argument that they will not be able to adequately conduct discovery without 
knowing her true identity. However, that argument is eviscerated by Roe’s offer 
to disclose her name to the defendants for discovery purposes on condition that 
they do not disclose it to the general public. That is a reasonable way to 
reconcile the competing interests, and the district court can enter an appropriate 
protective order. The district court should have granted Roe’s motion to proceed 
anonymously. 
 
Here, Plaintiff will cooperate with the court and the Defendants and reveal Plaintiff’s 
identity to Defendants for discovery purposes on the condition that Defendants do not disclose 
Plaintiff’s name to the general public. 
Just recently, under circumstances virtually identical to that of Jane Doe 17, Judge Castel 
granted a Motion to Proceed Anonymously in the matter of Katlyn Doe v. Darren K. Indyke, et 
al., Case No. 19-cv-7771-PKC finding the presence of at least 7 of the 10 Sealed Plaintiff factors 
which either supported or weighed strongly in favor of permitting the Plaintiff to proceed 
anonymously.  The Court held that “the public right to know is substantially outweighed by the 
plaintiff’s legitimate need for anonymity and that prejudice to a defendant can be mitigated by 
orders of the Court.”  A copy of Judge Castel’s Order of September 11, 2019 is annexed hereto 
as Exhibit A. 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
The balancing factors articulated by the Second Circuit weigh in favor of protecting 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 5 of 13

Plaintiff’s identity by allowing her to proceed anonymously. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff 
respectfully requests that the Court grant her Motion for Leave to Proceed Anonymously.

DARREN K. INDYKE, et al.., 
Defendant. 
-----------------------------------------------------------x 
CASTEL, U.S.D.J. 
19-cv-7771 (PKC) 
ORDER 
Plaintiff seeks leave to proceed in this action without disclosing her identity using 
instead a pseudonym. She alleges that Jeffrey Epstein, with the assistance of associates and 
entities, engaged in "manipulate[ion]," "c011trol," "sexual exploitation," "sexual assault[]," 
"sexual abuse," and "forced ... intercourse" of or with plaintiff; she was seventeen when the 
course of conduct began. (Complaint ,r,r 58-68.) At this juncture, no defendant has been served. 
Rule I0(a), Fed. R. Civ. P., provides that "[t]he title of [a] complaint must name 
all the parties." The Second Circuit has recognized that the use of a pseudonym is, however, 
appropriate in limited circumstances where the reasons for anonymity outweigh the public's right 
of access to judicial proceedings and any prejudice to a defendant. Sealed Plaintiffv. Sealed 
Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 189 (2d Cir. 2008). The Circuit's opinion in Sealed Plaintiff lays out 
ten non-exhaustive factors to be considered in determining whether to allow a case to proceed on 
an anonymous basis. Id. at 190. The Court analyzes the Complaint in light of these factors.

Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 10 of 13
(1) whether the litigation involves matters that are 
highly sensitive and of a 
personal nature. 
The Complaint alleges an on-going pattern of sexual assault and abuse beginning 
when plaintiff was seventeen years-old and asserts that she has and is continuing to suffer 
psychological injury as a result. (Complaint 1152-65.) These are highly sensitive allegations of 
a personal nature. 
(2) whether identification of the plaintiff poses a risk of 
physical or mental retaliation to the plaintiff or to a 
third paity. 
No risk of retaliation is alleged. Jeffrey Epstein is dead and there is no credible 
evidence of a risk of retaliation from others. There is an allegation of threats of retaliation in the 
past if she did not comply with demands for sex acts that she would suffer financial, 
psychological, and reputational harm (Id. 1 84) but no facts me alleged that those threats are 
likely to continue after the death of Epstein. 
(3) whether identification of plaintiff poses the risk of other 
harms, their likely severity and whether they ai·e of the type 
that the litigation seeks to redress. 
The nature of the allegations make it logical to conclude at this emly stage that 
disclosure of plaintiffs identity would cause further psychological hmm to plaintiff which is the 
precise hann the litigation seeks, in pai-t, to redress.

Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 11 of 13
( 4) whether there are other factors that make the 
plaintiff paiticularly vulnerable to hmm of 
disclosure, for exainple, because of her age. 
By the Comt's calculation, the plaintiff is 29 or 30. She is described in the 
complaint as having physical conditions that make her paiticularly vulnerable. (Id. ,i,r 54-55.) 
She alleges that she has incmTed and will continue to incur "medical and psychological 
expenses" as a result of the conduct alleged. (Id. ,i 132.) 
(5) whether the action challenges the actions of government or 
government actors, or merely private parties. 
The actions alleged are not the actions of a government actor or instrumentality 
but rather those of private paities. 
( 6) the nature of any prejudice to a defendant from 
allowing the plaintiff to proceed anonymously and 
whether any prejudice can be mitigated by the court. 
The Complaint alleges that the representatives of the estate of Epstein have 
liability for his actions. It also alleges that various non-natural persons are liable for acts and 
omissions causing plaintiff harm. In such circumstances it is critical that the accused defendants 
know the identity of the plaintiff in order to investigate and defend against the claim. The Court 
can mitigate the prejudice to defendants by requiring the disclosure of the actual name of the 
plaintiff in a document to be served on defendants and also filed under seal with the Comt. 
Plaintiff does not object to disclosure "for discovery purposes on the condition that Defendants 
do not disclose Plaintiff's name to the general public." (P. Mem. 6; Doc 3-1.)

(7) whether the plaintiff's identity has thns far been 
kept confidential. 
Insofar as the Comi is aware, the identity of the plaintiff is not widely known. 
(8) whether there is a legitimate public interest or 
benefit in requiring the plaintiff 
to disclose her identity. 
There is public interest in the litigation because of the notoriety of Epstein and 
those with whom he associated, but disclosure of the identity of the plaintiff is not likely to be of 
a legitimate importance or benefit to the public. 
(9) Whether the issues in the action are predominately 
or purely legal nature suggesting that the public 
interest in the plaintiffs identity may be weak. 
The issues in the case are not purely or predominately of a legal nature. This case 
turns principally on its facts. 
(I 0) whether there are any alternative mechanisms for 
protecting the confidentiality of the plaintiff. 
It is the disclosure of her identity that would exacerbate any preexisting harm to 
plaintiff and hence there is not alternative mechanism for protecting her confidentiality. 
CONCLUSION 
Factors 1 and 3 tilt strongly in favor of permitting plaintiff to proceed 
anonymously and are supported by factors 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10. Factors 2, 5, 9 are either neutral or

weakly support denying the motion. The Court concludes that, at this juncture, the public right to 
know is substantially outweighed by the plaintiffs legitimate need for anonymity and that 
prejudice to a defendant can be mitigated by orders of the Court. The Court reserves the right to 
modify this Order as the case progresses. 
Plaintiffs motion (Doc 3) is GRANTED. Within seven days of the appearance of 
a defendant, plaintiff shall disclose her identity to the appearing defendant in a document to be 
submitted to the Court for sealing. No defendant may disclose the identity of plaintiff to any 
person other than counsel without further order of this Comi. 
SO ORDERED.
