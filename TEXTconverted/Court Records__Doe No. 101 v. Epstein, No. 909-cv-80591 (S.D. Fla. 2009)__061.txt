PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWERS TO PLAINTFF’S 
FIRST REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS TO DEFENDANT  
 
 
Plaintiff Jane Doe, hereby moves this Court for an order compelling defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, to answer her first requests for admissions or, in the alternative, to 
prove that his invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege is proper. 
 
Jane Doe has propounded 23 requests for admission to Epstein, including such 
straightforward requests as: 
• Your net worth is greater than $1 billion. 
Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 61   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 4 of 10

 
               CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
 
5
• You own or control, directly or indirectly, real estate property in foreign 
countries. 
• You are moving significant financial assets overseas, outside of the direct 
territorial reach of the U.S. and Florida Courts. 
• You currently have the ability to post a bond of $15 million to satisfy a 
judgment in this case without financial or other difficulty. 
 
In response to each and every one of these questions, Epstein has given the 
following response: 
 
In response, Defendant asserts his U.S. constitutional privileges as 
specified herein.  I intend to respond to all relevant discovery regarding 
this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled me that I cannot 
provide answers to any discovery relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under 
the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
 
 
This Court should order Epstein to answer all of the requests for admission or, in 
the alternative, prove that his Fifth Amendment invocations are valid. It is for the court, 
not the claimant, to determine whether the hazard of incrimination is justified.  United 
States v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir. 1991).  “A court must make a 
particularized inquiry, deciding, in connection with each specific area that the 
questioning party wishes to explore, whether or not the privilege is well-founded.” Id.  
Typically this is done in an in camera proceeding wherein the person asserting the 
privilege is given the opportunity “to substantiate his claims of the privilege and the 
Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 61   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 5 of 10

 
               CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON

district court is able to consider the questions asked and the documents requested by 
the summons.”  Id.  
 
Here Epstein has made boilerplate invocation of the Fifth Amendment to each 
and every question propounded by Jane Doe, including for example a request that he 
admit that his net worth is more than $500 million.  It is not apparent how admitting his 
net worth is incriminating in the circumstances of this case.  In any event, the Fifth 
Amendment does not operate in this fashion. It is Epstein’s obligation to explain his 
claims on a “question-by-question basis.”  Id.   
 
The only issue before the Court is Epstein’s Fifth Amendment privilege.  Epstein 
has only asserted a Fifth Amendment objection to production.  As a result, any other 
objections to production are deemed waived.  See Local Rule 26.1G.3.(a) (“Any ground 
[for an objection] not stated in an objection within the time provided by the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure, or any extensions thereof, shall be waived.”). 
SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION 
 
For the convenience of the court – and in compliance with Local Rule 26.1 H 
(party filing motion to compel shall list specific requests in succession) – Jane Doe’s 
requests for admission are as follows: 
 
1.  Your net worth is greater than $10 million. 
 
2.  Your net worth is greater than $50 million. 
 
3.  Your net worth is greater than $100 million. 
 
4.  Your net worth is greater than $500 million. 
 
5.  Your net worth is greater than $1 billion.

7.  You own or control, directly or indirectly, real estate property in the Caribbean.

countries.

or giving you oral sex.

against her.

fondled her. 
 
17.  You intend to hire investigators to intimidate and harass Plaintiff during this 
litigation.

               CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON

19.  You coerced Plaintiff into being a prostitute and remaining in prostitution. 
 
20.  You are guilty of the following offenses against Jane Doe: 
 
A.  Procuring a minor for the purpose of prostitution as defined in F.S. 796.03; 
 
B.  Battery as defined by Florida Statutes. 
 
C.  Sexual Battery. 
 
21.  You are moving significant financial assets overseas, outside of the direct 
territorial reach of the U.S. and Florida Courts. 
 
22.  You are making asset transfers with the intent to defeat any judgment that 
might be entered against you in this or similar cases. 
 
23.  You currently have the ability to post a bond of $15 million to satisfy a 
judgment in this case without financial or other difficulty. 
CONCLUSION 
 
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the requests 
for admission or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment invocation 
with regard to each request.  Counsel for Jane Doe have conferred with opposing 
counsel on the issues raised in this motion, and no resolution was possible.
