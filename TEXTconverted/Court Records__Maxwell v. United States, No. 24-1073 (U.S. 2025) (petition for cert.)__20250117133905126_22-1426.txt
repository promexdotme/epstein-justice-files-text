Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). Maxwell was 
convicted of conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b)(2). She was principally sentenced to 
concurrent terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240 
months, respectively, to be followed by concurrent terms of 
supervised release. 
On appeal, the questions presented are whether (1) Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida barred Maxwell’s 
prosecution by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York; (2) a second superseding indictment of March 
29, 2021, complied with the statute of limitations; (3) the District Court 
abused its discretion in denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new 
trial based on the claimed violation of her Sixth Amendment right to a 
fair and impartial jury; (4) the District Court’s response to a jury note 
resulted in a constructive amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, 
the allegations in the second superseding indictment; and (5) 
Maxwell’s sentence was procedurally reasonable.  
Identifying no errors in the District Court’s conduct of this 
complex case, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2022, judgment 
of conviction.

JOSÉ A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge: 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). Maxwell was 
convicted of conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b)(2). The District Court imposed concurrent 
terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240 months, 
respectively, to be followed by concurrent terms of supervised release

4 
of three years, three years, and five years, respectively. The District 
Court also imposed a fine of $250,000 on each count for a total of 
$750,000. 
On appeal, the questions presented are (1) whether Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”) 
barred Maxwell’s prosecution by the United States Attorney’s Office 
for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”); (2) whether 
Maxwell’s second superseding indictment of March 29, 2021 (the 
“Indictment”) complied with the statute of limitations; (3) whether the 
District Court abused its discretion in denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 
motion for a new trial based on the claimed violation of her Sixth 
Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury; (4) whether the District 
Court’s response to a jury note resulted in a constructive amendment 
of, or prejudicial variance from, the allegations in the Indictment; and 
(5) whether Maxwell’s sentence was procedurally reasonable. 
We hold that Epstein’s NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution 
by USAO-SDNY as the NPA does not bind USAO-SDNY.  We hold 
that Maxwell’s Indictment complied with the statute of limitations as 
18 U.S.C. § 3283 extended the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for 
offenses committed before the date of the statute’s enactment. We 
further hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on one juror’s 
erroneous answers during voir dire. We also hold that the District 
Court’s response to a jury note did not result in a constructive 
amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, the allegations in the 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page4 of 26

5 
Indictment. Lastly, we hold that Maxwell’s sentence is procedurally 
reasonable. 
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction. 
I.  BACKGROUND 1 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell coordinated, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of women and underage 
girls. Starting in 1994, Maxwell groomed numerous young women to 
engage in sexual activity with Epstein by building friendships with 
these young women, gradually normalizing discussions of sexual 
topics and sexual abuse. Until about 2004, this pattern of sexual abuse 
continued as Maxwell provided Epstein access to underage girls in 
various locations in the United States. 
1. Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement  
In September 2007, following state and federal investigations 
into allegations of Epstein’s unlawful sexual activity, Epstein entered 
into an NPA with USAO-SDFL. In the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead 
guilty to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida 
 
1 Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are drawn from the evidence presented at trial 
and described in the light most favorable to the Government. See United States v. Litwok, 678 
F.3d 208, 210-11 (2d Cir. 2012) (“Because this is an appeal from a judgment of conviction 
entered after a jury trial, the [ ] facts are drawn from the trial evidence and described in the 
light most favorable to the Government.”).

Statutes § 796.07,2 and to one count of solicitation of minors to engage 
in prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.03.3  He agreed to 
receive a sentence of eighteen months’ imprisonment on the two 
charges. In consideration of Epstein’s agreement, the NPA states that 
“the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal 
charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but 
not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia 
Marcinkova.”4 
2. Maxwell’s Indictment and Trial-Related Proceedings 
The Indictment filed against Maxwell contained eight counts, 
six of which proceeded to trial.5 Prior to the commencement of trial, 
 
2 Florida Statutes § 796.07 provides in relevant part:  
(2) It is unlawful:  
(f) To solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution, 
lewdness, or assignation. 
3 Florida Statutes § 796.03, which has since been repealed, provided in relevant part: “A 
person who procures for prostitution, or causes to be prostituted, any person who is under 
the age of 18 years commits a felony of the second degree.” 
4 A-178. 
5 Count One charged Maxwell with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Two charged Maxwell with enticement of a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count 
Three charged Maxwell with conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Four charged Maxwell with 
transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. §§ 2423(a) and 2. Count Five charged Maxwell with sex traﬃcking conspiracy, in 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page6 of 26

prospective jurors completed a lengthy questionnaire, with several 
questions raising issues relevant to the trial. Based on the completed 
questionnaires, the parties selected prospective jurors to proceed to in-
person voir dire. The District Court ultimately empaneled a jury. 
During the four-and-a-half-week jury trial, the Government 
presented evidence of the repeated sexual abuse of six girls. At the 
conclusion of trial, on December 29, 2021, the jury found Maxwell 
guilty on all but one count.6  
Following the verdict, Juror 50 gave press interviews during 
which he stated that he was a survivor of child sexual abuse.7 In his 
answers to the written jury questionnaire, however, Juror 50 answered 
“no” to three questions asking whether he or a friend or family 
member had ever been the victim of a crime; whether he or a friend or 
family member had ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual 
abuse, or sexual assault; and whether he or a friend or family member 
had ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual 
 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Six charged Maxwell with sex traﬃcking of a minor, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2. Counts Seven and Eight charged Maxwell 
with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The perjury charges were severed from the 
remaining charges and ultimately dismissed at sentencing. 
6 The jury found Maxwell guilty on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six. Maxwell was 
acquitted on Count Two. 
7 Consistent with a juror anonymity order entered for trial, the parties and the District Court 
referred to the jurors by pseudonym.

assault.8 Upon learning of the interviews, the Government filed a letter 
on January 5, 2022, requesting a hearing; Maxwell then moved for a 
new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. On March 8, 
2022, the District Court held a hearing and Juror 50 testified—under 
grant of immunity—that his answers to three questions related to 
sexual abuse in the jury questionnaire were not accurate but that the 
answers were an inadvertent mistake and that his experiences did not 
affect his ability to be fair and impartial. Finding Juror 50’s testimony 
to be credible, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion for a new 
trial in a written order.   
Maxwell was subsequently sentenced to a term of 240 months’ 
imprisonment to be followed by five years’ supervised release, and the 
 
8 Question 2 asked “[h]ave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim 
of a crime?” Question 48 asked “[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been the 
victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or 
attempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, 
acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)” Finally, Question 49 asked  
[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual harassment, 
sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes both formal accusations in a court of 
law or informal accusations in a social or work setting of actual or attempted sexual 
assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, 
supervisor, teacher, or family member.

District Court imposed a $750,000 fine and a $300 mandatory special 
assessment. This appeal followed. 
II.  DISCUSSION 
1. The NPA Between Epstein and USAO-SDFL Did Not Bar 
Maxwell’s Prosecution by USAO-SDNY 
Maxwell sought dismissal of the charges in the Indictment on the 
grounds that the NPA made between Epstein and USAO-SDFL 
immunized her from prosecution on all counts as a third-party 
beneficiary of the NPA. The District Court denied the motion, rejecting 
Maxwell’s arguments. We agree. We review de novo the denial of a 
motion to dismiss an indictment.9  
In arguing that the NPA barred her prosecution by USAO-SDNY, 
Maxwell cites the portion of the NPA in which “the United States [ ] 
agree[d] that it w[ould] not institute any criminal charges against any 
potential co-conspirators of Epstein.”10 We hold that the NPA with 
USAO-SDFL does not bind USAO-SDNY. 
It is well established in our Circuit that “[a] plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which 
the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement 
 
9 See, e.g., United States v. Walters, 910 F.3d 11, 22 (2d Cir. 2018).  
10 A-178. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page9 of 26

10 
contemplates a broader restriction.”11 And while Maxwell contends 
that we cannot apply Annabi to an agreement negotiated and executed 
outside of this Circuit, we have previously done just that.12 Applying 
Annabi, we conclude that the NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution 
by USAO-SDNY. There is nothing in the NPA that affirmatively shows 
that the NPA was intended to bind multiple districts. Instead, where 
the NPA is not silent, the agreement’s scope is expressly limited to the 
Southern District of Florida. The NPA makes clear that if Epstein 
fulfilled his obligations, he would no longer face charges in that district: 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 
and 2 of this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been 
the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office, nor any 
 
11 United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985). We recognize that circuits have 
been split on this issue for decades. See United States v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 303 (4th Cir. 
1986); United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 550 (3d Cir. 2002). 
12 See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) (summary order) 
(applying Annabi to plea agreement entered into in the District of New Jersey); United States 
v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004) (summary order) (same, to agreement entered 
into in the District of New Mexico). Nor does Annabi, as Maxwell contends, apply only 
where subsequent charges are “suﬃciently distinct” from charges covered by an earlier 
agreement. In Annabi, this Court rejected an interpretation of a prior plea agreement that 
rested on the Double Jeopardy Clause, reasoning that even if the Double Jeopardy Clause 
applied, the subsequent charges were “suﬃciently distinct” and therefore fell outside the 
Clause’s protections. Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This Court did not, however, conclude that the 
rule of construction it announced depended on the similarities between earlier and 
subsequent charges. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page10 of 26

11 
offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation 
will be instituted in this District, and the charges against Epstein 
if any, will be dismissed.13  
The only language in the NPA that speaks to the agreement’s scope is 
limiting language.  
 
The negotiation history of the NPA, just as the text, fails to show 
that the agreement was intended to bind other districts. Under our 
Court’s precedent, the negotiation history of an NPA can support an 
inference that an NPA “affirmatively” binds other districts.14 Yet, the 
actions of USAO-SDFL do not indicate that the NPA was intended to 
bind other districts.  
The United States Attorney’s Manual that was operable during 
the negotiations of the NPA required that:  
No district or division shall make any agreement, including any 
agreement not to prosecute, which purports to bind any other 
district(s) or division without the express written approval of 
 
13 A-175 (emphasis added). The agreement’s scope is also limited in an additional section:  
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for 
the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these oﬀenses shall be 
deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein 
abides by the following conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set forth 
below.  
Id. (emphasis added). 
14 See United States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986).   
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page11 of 26

12 
the United States Attorney(s) in each affected district and/or the 
Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division.15 
Nothing before us indicates that USAO-SDNY had been notified or 
had approved of Epstein’s NPA with USAO-SDFL and intended to be 
bound by it. And the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal 
Division stated in an interview with the Office of Professional 
Responsibility that she “played no role” in the NPA, either by 
reviewing or approving the agreement. 
The history of the Office of the United States Attorney is instructive 
as to the scope of their actions and duties. The Judiciary Act of 1789 
created the Office of the United States Attorney, along with the office 
of the Attorney General. More specifically, the Judiciary Act provided 
for the appointment, in each district, of a “person learned in the law to 
act as attorney for the United States in such district, who shall be sworn 
or affirmed to the faithful execution of his office, whose duty it shall 
be to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences, 
cognizable under the authority of the United States, and all civil 
actions in which the United States shall be concerned.”16 The Judiciary 
Act thus emphasized that U.S. Attorneys would enforce the law of the 
United States but did not determine that the actions of one U.S. 
Attorney could bind other districts, let alone the entire nation. In fact, 
the phrase “in such district,” repeated twice, implies that the scope of 
 
15 United States Attorney’s Manual § 9-27.641 (2007).  
16 An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States, ch. 20, § 35, 1 Stat. 73, 92-93 
(1789) (emphasis added). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page12 of 26

13 
the actions and the duties of the U.S. Attorneys would be limited to 
their own districts, absent any express exceptions. 
Since 1789, while the number of federal districts has grown 
significantly, the duties of a U.S. Attorney and their scope remain 
largely unchanged. By statute, U.S. Attorneys, “within [their] district, 
shall (1) prosecute for all offenses against the United States; (2) 
prosecute or defend, for the Government, all civil actions, suits or 
proceedings in which the United States is concerned.”17 Again, the 
scope of the duties of a U.S. Attorney is cabined to their specific district 
unless otherwise directed.18 
 
In short, Annabi controls the result here.  Nothing in the text of 
the NPA or its negotiation history suggests that the NPA precluded 
USAO-SDNY from prosecuting Maxwell for the charges in the 
 
17 28 U.S.C. § 547.  
18 This does not suggest that there are no instances in which a U.S. Attorney’s powers do not 
extend beyond their districts. For instance, under 28 U.S.C. § 515 a U.S. Attorney can 
represent the Government or participate in proceedings in other districts, but only when 
speciﬁcally directed by the Attorney General:  
The Attorney General or any other oﬃcer of the Department of Justice, or any 
attorney specially appointed by the Attorney General under law, may, when 
speciﬁcally directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal proceeding 
. . . which United States attorneys are authorized by law to conduct, whether or not 
he is a resident of the district in which the proceeding is brought. 
 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page13 of 26

14 
Indictment. The District Court therefore correctly denied Maxwell’s 
motion without an evidentiary hearing. 
2. The Indictment Is Timely 
Maxwell argues that Counts Three and Four of the Indictment 
are untimely because they do not fall within the scope of offenses 
involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and 
thereby do not fall within the extended statute of limitations provided 
by § 3283.19 Separately, Maxwell contends that the Government cannot 
apply the 2003 amendment to § 3283 that extended the statute of 
limitations to those offenses that were committed before the enactment 
into law of the provision. On both points, we disagree and hold that 
the District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the 
charges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to 
dismiss an indictment and the application of a statute of limitations.20 
First, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses 
involving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly 
applied Weingarten v. United States.21 In Weingarten, we explained that 
Congress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific 
 
19 18 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude 
prosecution for an oﬀense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child 
under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for 
ten years after the oﬀense, whichever is longer.”  
20 United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2018).  
21 865 F.3d 48, 58-60 (2d Cir. 2017); see also United States v. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d 299, 313-
14 (S.D.N.Y. 2021). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page14 of 26

15 
approach as opposed to a “categorical approach.”22 We see no reason 
to depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question 
presented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual 
abuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the 
case. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that 
she had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a 
minor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283 
applies to those oﬀenses.  
Second, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the 
Indictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the 
extended statute of limitations provided by the 2003 amendment to 
§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI 
Film Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding 
whether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether 
Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.”23 If 
Congress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the 
 
22 The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to 
look “only to the statutory deﬁnitions of the prior oﬀenses, and not to the particular facts 
underlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United 
States, 495 U.S. 575, 600 (1990). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of 
the conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach. 
See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-60. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] . . . reaches beyond the 
oﬀense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the oﬀense.” Id. at 59-60. Second, 
legislative history suggests that Congress intended § 3283 to be applied broadly. Id. at 60. 
Third, a case-speciﬁc approach would not produce practical diﬃculties or potential 
unfairness. Id.  
23 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994); see also Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54-55.  
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page15 of 26

16 
statute as it is written.”24 If the statute “is ambiguous or contains no 
express command regarding retroactivity, a reviewing court must 
determine whether applying the statute to antecedent conduct would 
create presumptively impermissible retroactive effects.”25 
  
Here, the inquiry is straightforward.  In 2003, Congress 
amended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would 
otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall 
preclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”26 The text of 
§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude 
prosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it 
prevent the application of any statute of limitations that would 
otherwise apply to past conduct.   
The statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend 
the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as 
the prior statute of limitations was inadequate. This is enough to 
conclude that the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 applies to 
Maxwell’s conduct as charged in the Indictment.

3. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying 
Maxwell’s Motion for a New Trial 
Maxwell contends that she was deprived of her constitutional right 
to a fair and impartial jury because Juror 50 failed to accurately 
respond to several questions related to his history of sexual abuse as 
part of the jury questionnaire during jury selection. Following a special 
evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion for a 
new trial.  
We review a District Court’s denial of a motion for a new trial for 
abuse of discretion.27 We have been extremely reluctant to “haul jurors 
in after they have reached a verdict in order to probe for potential 
instances of bias, misconduct or extraneous influences.”28 While courts 
can “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice 
so requires,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a), they should do so “sparingly” and 
only in “the most extraordinary circumstances.”29 A district court “has 
 
27 See Rivas v. Brattesani, 94 F.3d 802, 807 (2d Cir. 1996). “[W]e are mindful that a judge has 
not abused her discretion simply because she has made a diﬀerent decision than we would 
have made in the ﬁrst instance.” United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 2001). 
We have repeatedly explained that the term of art “abuse of discretion” includes errors of 
law, a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or “a decision that cannot be located 
within the range of permissible decisions.” In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir. 2008)

broad discretion to decide Rule 33 motions based upon its evaluation 
of the proof produced” and is shown deference on appeal.30  
A Rule 33 motion based on a juror’s alleged erroneous response 
during voir dire is governed by McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. 
Greenwood.31 Under McDonough, a party seeking a new trial “must first 
demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question 
on voir dire, and then further show that a correct response would have 
provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.”32 
The District Court applied the McDonough standard, found Juror 
50’s testimony credible, and determined that Juror 50’s erroneous 
responses during voir dire were “not deliberately incorrect” and that 
“he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate 
responses to the questionnaire.”33 In fact, as the District Court noted, 
Maxwell did not challenge the inclusion of other jurors who disclosed 
past experience with sexual abuse, assault, or harassment. This is

of a [ ] trial because of a juror’s mistaken, though honest response to a question, is to insist 
on something closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.”

enough; the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Maxwell’s motion for a new trial.34   
4. The District Court’s Response to a Jury Note Did Not Result 
in a Constructive Amendment of, or Prejudicial Variance 
from, the Allegations in the Indictment 
During jury deliberations, the jury sent the following jury note 
regarding Count Four of the Indictment: 
Under Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the 
transportation of Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to 
New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in 
sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second 
element?35 
The District Court determined that it would not respond to the note 
directly because it was difficult to “parse factually and legally” and 
instead referred the jury to the second element of Count Four.36 
 
34 Nor did the District Court err in questioning Juror 50 rather than allowing the parties to 
do so. In conducting a hearing on potential juror misconduct, “[w]e leave it to the district 
court’s discretion to decide the extent to which the parties may participate in questioning 
the witnesses, and whether to hold the hearing in camera.” United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 
540, 544 (2d Cir. 1989). And while Maxwell contends that the District Court improperly 
limited questioning about Juror 50’s role in deliberations, she both waived that argument 
below and fails to show here how any such questioning would not be foreclosed by Federal 
Rule of Evidence 606(b).   
35 A-238.  
36 A-207-221. The District Court’s instruction on the second element of Count Four required 
the jury to ﬁnd that “Maxwell knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce with the 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page19 of 26

20 
Maxwell subsequently filed a letter seeking reconsideration of the 
District Court’s response, claiming that this response resulted in a 
constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. The District Court 
declined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion. 
Maxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the 
alleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury 
Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that 
testimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the 
jury with another basis for conviction, which is distinct from the 
charges in the Indictment. Similarly, Maxwell argues that this 
testimony resulted in a prejudicial variance from the Indictment.  We 
disagree and affirm the District Court’s denial.  
  
We review the denial of a motion claiming constructive 
amendment or prejudicial variance de novo.37 To satisfy the Fifth 
Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the 
elements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the 
charge against which he must defend.”38 We have explained that to 
prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must 
demonstrate that “the terms of the indictment are in effect altered by 
the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify 
essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial 
 
intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a 
criminal oﬀense in violation of New York law.” A-205. 
37 See United States v. Dove, 884 F.3d 138, 146, 149 (2d Cir. 2018). 
38 United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2021).

21 
likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense 
other than that charged in the indictment.”39 A constructive 
amendment requires reversal.40 
 
We cannot conclude that a constructive amendment resulted 
from the evidence presented by the Government—namely, Jane’s 
testimony—or that it can be implied from the jury note. We have 
permitted significant flexibility in proof as long as a defendant was 
“given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”41 In turn, 
“[t]he core of criminality of an offense involves the essence of a crime, 
in general terms; the particulars of how a defendant effected the crime 
falls outside that purview.”42 
 
We agree with the District Court that the jury instructions, the 
evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s summation 
captured the core of criminality. As the District Court noted, while the 
jury note was ambiguous in one sense, it was clear that it referred to 
the second element of Count Four of the Indictment. Therefore, the 
District Court correctly directed the jury to that instruction, which 
“accurately instructed that Count Four had to be predicated on finding

22 
a violation of New York law.”43 It is therefore not “uncertain whether 
[Maxwell] was convicted of conduct that was the subject of the grand 
jury’s indictment.”44 
 
We also cannot conclude that the evidence at trial prejudicially 
varied from the Indictment. To allege a variance, a defendant “must 
establish that the evidence offered at trial differs materially from the 
evidence alleged in the indictment.”45 To prevail and win reversal, the 
defendant must further show “that substantial prejudice occurred at 
trial as a result” of the variance.46 “A defendant cannot demonstrate 
that he has been prejudiced by a variance where the pleading and the 
proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character 
that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the 
variance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be 
protected against another prosecution for the same offense.”47 
 
For reasons similar to the ones noted above in the context of the 
constructive amendment, the evidence at trial did not prove facts 
 
43 A-387; see United States v. Parker, 903 F.2d 91, 101 (2d Cir. 1990) (“The trial judge is in the 
best position to sense whether the jury is able to proceed properly with its deliberations, 
and [ ] has considerable discretion in determining how to respond to communications 
indicating that the jury is experiencing confusion.”)

23 
“materially different” from the allegations in the Indictment.48 The 
evidence indicated that Maxwell transported Jane to New York for 
sexual abuse and conspired to do the same. Maxwell knew that the 
evidence also included conduct in New Mexico.49 Furthermore, 
Maxwell cannot demonstrate “substantial prejudice.” Maxwell 
received—over three weeks before trial—notes of Jane’s interview 
recording the abuse she suffered in New Mexico. This is enough to 
conclude that Maxwell was not “unfairly and substantially” 
prejudiced.50 
5. Maxwell’s Sentence Was Procedurally Reasonable 
Lastly, Maxwell argues that her sentence was procedurally 
unreasonable because the District Court erred in applying a leadership 
sentencing enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines and 
inadequately explained its above-Guidelines sentence.51  We disagree.   
 
48 Dove, 884 F.3d at 149.  
49 As the District Court found, “[t]he Indictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse 
underage girls in New York. In service of this scheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein 
and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at various properties and in various 
states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico.” A-393. 
50 See United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 40, 54 (2d Cir. 2019) (concluding that a defendant was 
not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed the 
evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). 
51 At sentencing, the District Court calculated a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months’ 
imprisonment and sentenced Maxwell to a slightly above-Guidelines term of 240 months’ 
imprisonment.

We review a sentence for both procedural and substantive 
reasonableness, which “amounts to review for abuse of discretion.”52  
We have explained that procedural error is found when a district court 
“fails to calculate (or improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines 
range, treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider 
the [Section] 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly 
erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.”53 
The District Court did none of that. It is important to emphasize that 
the Sentencing Guidelines “are guidelines—that is, they are truly 
advisory.”54 A District Court is “generally free to impose sentences 
outside the recommended range” based on its own “informed and 
individualized judgment.”55 
With respect to the four-level leadership enhancement, the District 
Court found that Maxwell “supervised” Sarah Kellen in part because 
of testimony from two of Epstein’s pilots who testified that Kellen was 
Maxwell’s assistant. The District Court found that testimony credible, 
in part because it was corroborated by other testimony that Maxwell 
was Epstein’s “number two and the lady of the house” in Palm Beach, 
 
52 United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 187 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc). “Regardless of whether 
the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must 
review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.” Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 
38, 51 (2007).  
53 United States v. Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 38 (2d Cir. 2012). 
54 Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189.

25 
where much of the abuse occurred and where Kellen worked.56 We 
therefore hold that the District Court did not err in applying the 
leadership enhancement. 
With respect to the length of the sentence, the District Court 
properly discussed the sentencing factors when imposing the 
sentence, and described, at length, Maxwell’s “pivotal role in 
facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls through a series of 
deceptive tactics.”57 The District Court recognized that the sentence 
“must reflect the gravity of Ms. Maxwell’s conduct, of Ms. Maxwell’s 
offense, the pivotal role she played in facilitating the offense, and the 
significant and lasting harm it inflicted.”58 And the District Court 
explained that “a very serious, a very significant sentence is necessary 
to achieve the purposes of punishment” under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In 
sum, the District Court did not err by failing to adequately explain its 
sentence.  
 
CONCLUSION 
To summarize, we hold as follows:

57 SA-459.

1.  The District Court did not err in holding that Epstein’s NPA 
with USAO-SDFL did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution by USAO-
SDNY. 
2. The District Court did not err in holding that the Indictment 
was filed within the statute of limitations.  
3. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial. 
4. The District Court’s response to a jury note did not result in a 
constructive amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, the 
allegations in the Indictment.  
5. The District Court’s sentence was procedurally reasonable.  
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 
29, 2022, judgment of conviction.
