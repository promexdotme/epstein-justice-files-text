UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 09-CV-80802-MARRA-JOHNSON 
JANE DOE NO. 8 
Plaintiff, 
V. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
------------~! 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S REPLY TO PLAINTIFF'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN 
OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT. dated 08/12/09 
Defendant EPSTEIN, by and through his attorneys, replies to Plaintiff JANE DOE 
No. 8's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint, 
("memorandum"), dated August 12, 2009. In support of dismissal of Count I - "Sexual 
Assault and Battery" and Count Ill - "Coercion and Enticement to Sexual Activity in 
Violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422," based on the statute of limitations, Defendant replies: 
Introduction 
Defendant's position is that Counts I and Ill are each barred by the applicable 
statute of limitations. 
Since the issues in parts I and II of Plaintiff's memorandum 
overlap, Defendant will address those parts together in I and II herein. 
Part Ill 
addresses the statute of limitations for Count Ill, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. §2255{b). 
I. 
Plaintiff's Complaint on its face does show the date that her claims accrued. 
II. 
Based on the Complaint allegations. §95.11 (7). Fla. Stat .• does not apply to 
Count I - Assault and Battery; thus, such claim is time barred. 
Pursuant to the allegations on the face of Plaintiff's complaint, Count I, based on 
Florida's common law of assault and battery, and Count Ill, brought pursuant to 18 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/20/2009   Page 2 of 10
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page2 
U.S.C. §2255, are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 
Plaintiff and 
Defendant are in agreement that a Rule 12(b}(6) dismissal on statute of limitations 
grounds is appropriate where "it is 'apparent from the face of the complaint' that the 
claim is time-barred." See generally, La Grasta v. First Union Securities, Inc., 358 F.3d 
840, 845 -846 (11 th Cir. 2004). 
However, contrary to Plaintiff's assertion in section I, p. 2, of her memorandum, 
based on the allegations of the Complaint, Plaintiff's claims alleged in Count I and Ill are 
time barred. Plaintiff now attempts to rely on the "discovery rule" in an effort to argue 
that the cause of action accrued at some later date; however, and significantly, there 
are no allegations in Count I that implicate application of the discovery rule which is 
codified in Florida Statute §95.11 (7). 
Hearndon v. Graham, 767 So.2d 1179 (Fla. 
2000). Hearndon dealt with the accrual of a cause of action where a plaintiff alleges 
that she suffered from traumatic amnesia caused by childhood sexual abuse. The 
Florida Supreme Court answered the following question in the affirmative: 
Where a plaintiff in a tort action based on childhood sexual abuse alleges that 
she suffered from traumatic amnesia caused by the abuse, does the delayed 
discovery doctrine postpone accrual of the cause of action? 
The Hearndon plaintiff filed her complaint in 1991 against her stepfather for 
injuries from alleged sexual abuse committed upon her beginning in 1968 when she 
was 8, and continuing until 1975 when she turned 15. She further alleged that she 
suffered from "'traumatic amnesia,' or a related syndrome [until approximately 1988], 
caused by the abuses allegedly perpetrated by [the defendant], thereby explaining why 
earlier commencement of the action had not been possible." Id, at 1181. The plaintiff 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/20/2009   Page 3 of 10
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page3 
claimed the sexual abuse caused her to suppress or lose her memory for several years. 
The Supreme Court noted that in reaching its decision allowing the accrual of the action 
to be delayed, it was not passing on the merits of whether she actually lost and then 
retrieved her memory, or on the reliability of any of the psychological techniques used to 
bring back the memories of the abuse. 
As noted in Hearndon, the Florida Legislature codified the discovery rule 
in intentional abuse cases when it enacted §95.11 (7), Fla.Statutes. 
§95.11 (7) was 
found not to apply in Hearndon because the alleged sexual abuse occurred from 1968 
to 1975, and the abuse was not recalled until 1988. The plaintiff filed her complaint in 
1991. 
The statute became effective in 1992. 
See endnote 1 herein; Davis v. 
Monhanan, 832 So.2d 708, 709-10 (Fla. 2002)(The Florida Legislature has imposed a 
delayed discovery rule in cases of professional malpractice, medical malpractice, and 
intentional torts based on abuse, there is no other statutory basis for application of the 
delayed discovery rule to delay the accrual of a cause of action). The discussion in 
Hearndon remains relevant as it explains how and when the statutory discovery rule 
applies, and its effect on the accrual of a cause of action. 
The Hearndon decision should be read in conjunction with Davis v. Monahan, 832 
So.2d 708 (Fla. 2002). 
In Davis, the Florida Supreme Court made clear that the 
statutory codification of the delayed discovery rule only applies to those causes of 
actions enumerated in §95.11, Fla.Stat., and refused to extend the ruling in Hearndon to 
causes of action not based on the statutory enumerated exceptions or to causes of 
actions not based on allegations of childhood sexual abuse where a plaintiff has 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/20/2009   Page 4 of 10

Page4 
traumatic amnesia or a repressed memory type condition. In refusing to broaden the 
ruling in Hearndon and apply the delayed discovery doctrine to claims for breach of 
fiduciary duty, conversion, civil conspiracy, and unjust enrichment, the Florida Supreme 
Court, Davis, supra at 712, stated: 
While we applied the delayed discovery doctrine to causes of action arising 
out of childhood sexual abuse and repressed memory in Hearndon, we did so 
only after considering the unique and sinister nature of childhood sexual abuse, 
as well as the fact that the doctrine is applicable to similar cases where the 
tortious acts cause the delay in discovery. We also considered the Legislature's 
endorsement in amending section 95.11 (7), Florida Statutes (1999), to include 
intentional torts based on abuse and the fact that the application of the doctrine 
among the states is both the majority rule and modern trend. In this case, there 
is no modern trend or statutory endorsement, and Monahan did not allege 
fraud, so there was no specific allegation that Davis or Kish's actions caused 
Monahan's delayed discovery. 
Plaintiff is correct that part of the analysis as to whether a particular claim is time 
barred involves an analysis as to when a particular cause of action has accrued. Under 
Florida law, a statute of limitations "runs from the time the cause of action accrues" 
which, in turn, is generally determined by the date "when the last element constituting 
the cause of action occurs." § 95.031, Fla. Stat.1 See generally State Farm Mut. Auto. 
Ins. Co. v. Lee, 678 So.2d 818, 821 (Fla.1996)("[A] cause of action cannot be said to 
have accrued, within the meaning of the statute of limitations, until an action may be 
brought."); and Florida Power & Light Co. v. Allis Chalmers Corp., 85 F.3d 1514, 
1 §95.031, Fla.Stat., provides in relevant part : 
... the time within which an action shall be begun under any statute of limitations runs from 
the time the cause of action accrues. 
(1) A cause of action accrues when the last element constituting the cause of action occurs.

Page5 
rehearing denied (11 th Cir. 1996)(Cause of action accrues for limitations purposes when 
last element constituting cause of action occurs and plaintiff knew or should have 
discovered injury). Further, and significantly, the fact that a plaintiff does not know the 
full extent of his or her injury and that the most substantial damages do not occur until 
later date does not postpone running of limitations periods. Id. See also Penthouse 
North Ass'n, Inc. v. Lombardi, 461 So.2d 1350, 1352 (Fla. 1984)("A statute of limitation 
does not commence to run until the cause of action accrues. A cause of action does 
not accrue until someone has been damaged by the acts complained of."). 
As alleged in the Complaint, JANE DOE NO. 8 had one "encounter with Epstein" 
at his Palm Beach mansion "in or about 2001" when she was "then approximately 16 
years old, fell into Epstein's trap and became one of his victims." Comp. 1]9, 13-14. 
She further alleges that at the time of the one encounter, she "was frightened and felt 
trapped," and "as a result of this encounter with Epstein, [she] experienced confusion, 
shame, humiliation and embarrassment, and has suffered severe psychological and 
emotional injuries." Comp. 1]13-14. On the face of the Complaint, Plaintiff was aware 
that she was damaged at the time of the encounter complained. 
Because Plaintiff was allegedly a minor at the time, under Florida law, Plaintiff 
could not have brought the action in her own right. Both Plaintiff and Defendant are in 
agreement that the legal disability based on one being a minor is generally removed 
once a person turns 18 years of age. 
(JDS memorandum, fn. 2). 
Based on the 
allegations, it has been at least 8 years since Plaintiff "fell into Epstein's trap and

Page6 
became one of his victims; and Plaintiff is now at least 24 years old; Plaintiff turned 18 
at least 6 years ago, well pass the applicable 4 year statute of limitations. 
Under Florida law, the statute of limitations for assault and battery is 4 years, 
§95.11 (3)(o). See Defendant's Motion To Dismiss Complaint, dated July 14, 2009, [DE 
8], for discussion as to why §95.11 (7), Fla. Stat., does not apply to Plaintiff's Count I for 
"sexual assault and battery." See endnote 1 hereto for statutory text of subsection (7), 
including statutes referenced therein.1 
In her memorandum, Plaintiff attempts to rely on the statutory definition of 
"abuse" as set forth in §39.01 (2), Fla. Stat., and claims that she has "until 7 years after 
she reaches the age of majority to bring suit (i.e. until she is 25 years old), or within 4 
years from the time she discovers both the injury and the causal relationship between 
the injury and abuse, whichever occurs later." As noted above, there are no allegations 
of repressed memory or similar type traumatic amnesia. In fact, the allegations reveal 
that after the alleged one encounter, Plaintiff knew immediately that she suffered 
damage in or about 2001, when she was 16. She could have brought the action in 2003 
in her own right when she turned 18. She is now at least 24 years old. 
A review of the Count I allegations establish that Plaintiff is attempting to assert a 
claim for Florida's common law assault and battery to which a 4 year statute of limitation 
applies. See Defendant's motion to dismiss. As noted in fn. 1 of her memorandum, 
Defendant is not seeking dismissal of Count II as in i]24, Plaintiff tracks the language of 
§39.01 (2), Fla. Stat., pertaining to "abuse."

If this Court were to agree with Plaintiff's position that she has adequately pied a 
claim based on sex abuse in Count I, (which she has not), then either Count I or Count 
II - Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress is required to be dismissed as neither is "a 
free-standing tort" because both counts reallege the same underlying facts and 
damages. See Tobin v. Damian, 772 So.2d 13, fn. 1 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000). In discussing 
plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress the Court determined that it 
was "not a free-standing tort" because it "realleges the same facts mentioned in 
appellant's sexual abuse claims and fails to provide any additional facts." Citing to 
Fridovich v. Fridovich, 598 So.2d 65, 69-70 (Fla. 1992)(holding that no separate cause 
of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress existed where plaintiff merely 
renamed the initial cause of action and repled the same facts). 
Accordingly, Count I is required to be dismissed as the applicable statute of 
limitations has expired. In the alternative, either Count I or Count II is required to be 
dismissed as they are duplicative claims as opposed to free-standing torts. 
Ill. 
The Complaint on its face shows that Count Ill is time barred. 
Count Ill is brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255, which contains its own statute of 
limitations in subsection (b). The language of §2255(b) is clear and unambiguous -
"Any action commenced under this section shall be barred unless the complaint is filed 
within six years after the right of action first accrues or in the case of a person under a 
legal disability, not later than three years after the disability."2 Plaintiff now attempts to 
2 "The primary principle of statutory construction requires courts to give effect to the plain 
meaning of the words used "in their ordinary and usual sense." Caminetti v. U.S., 242 U.S. 470 
(1917). To the extent possible, the rules of statutory construction require courts to give meaning

argue that the delayed discovery doctrine applies although there are no allegations in 
the Complaint which implicate its application. 
The "delayed discovery" doctrine generally provides that a cause of action does not 
accrue until the plaintiff either knows or reasonably should know of the tortious act 
giving rise to the cause of action. 
The United States Supreme Court applied the 
"blameless ignorance" doctrine in Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 170, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 
93 L.Ed. 1282 (1949), thereby delaying the accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff 
reasonably discovered the right of action, reasoning that "the traditional purposes of 
statutes of limitations ... require the assertion of claims within a specified period of time 
after notice of the invasion of legal rights." Id. 
Again, the Complaint allegations are clear that Plaintiff was aware that she was an 
alleged "victim" as a result of the alleged one encounter with EPSTEIN in 2001, and that 
she allegedly suffered damages therefrom. By her own allegations she felt "frightened 
and trapped" at the time. There are no allegations of repressed memory or traumatic 
amnesia or other allegations which would delay the accrual of the cause of action. 
Based on the allegations of the Complaint, Plaintiff turned 18 in 2003 and, thus, she 
was no longer under the legal disability of being a minor. Approximately 8 years have 
passed since the alleged one time encounter -
well pass the 6 year statute of 
to every word and clause in a statute. U.S. v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-39 (1955); TRW 
Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001 ). Additionally, courts must reject statutory interpretations 
that would render portions of a statute surplusage. TRW, 534 at 31." Brotherhood of Loe. 
Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. v. CSX Transp., Inc., 522 F.3d 1190, 1194 -1195 (11 th 
Cir. 2008).

limitations; and approximately 6 years have passed since the legal disability of being a 
minor was removed - well passed the 3 year period. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court dismiss Counts I and Ill of 
Plaintiff's Complaint with prejudice. 
In the alternative, Defendant requests that this 
Court dismiss either Count I or II with prejudice, along with Count Ill wi 
rejudice.

(7) For intentional torts based on abuse.--An action founded on alleged abuse, 
as defined in s. 39.01, s. 415.102, ors. 984.03, or incest, as defined in s. 826.04, 
may be commenced at any time within 7 years after the age of majority, or within 4 
years after the injured person leaves the dependency of the abuser, or within 4 
years from the time of discovery by the injured party of both the injury and the 
causal relationship between the injury and the abuse, whichever occurs later. 
§39.01 (2), Fla. Stat. (2001) -
(2) "Abuse" means any willful act or threatened act that results in any physical, 
mental, or sexual injury or harm that causes or is likely to cause the child's 
physical, mental, or emotional health to be significantly impaired. Abuse of a child 
includes acts or omissions. Corporal discipline of a child by a parent or legal 
custodian for disciplinary purposes does not in itself constitute abuse when it does 
not result in harm to the child. 
§415.102(1), Fla. Stat. (2001)-
(1) "Abuse" means any willful act or threatened act that causes or is likely to cause 
significant impairment to a vulnerable adult's physical, mental, or emotional 
health. Abuse includes acts and omissions. 
§984.03 (2), Fla. Stat. (2001) -
"Abuse" means any willful act that results in any physical, mental, or sexual injury 
that causes or is likely to cause the child's physical, mental, or emotional health to 
be significantly impaired. Corporal discipline of a child by a parent or guardian for 
disciplinary purposes does not in itself constitute abuse when it does not result in 
harm to the child as defined in s. 39.01.
