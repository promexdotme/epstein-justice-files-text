Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 101, by and through her undersigned attorneys, hereby responds 
to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint [D.E. 29] ("Motion"), as 
modified by Defendant's Notice of Withdrawal [D.E. 53] ("Notice of Withdrawal") of

Complaint and, as grounds, states as follows: 
Pleading Standard & Summary of Argument 
It is well settled in the context of a civil action that a valid complaint requires only "a short and 
plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 
8(a)(2). Defendant improperly attempts to heighten this standard through his characterization of 
this action as one that is essentially criminal and punitive in nature. Such a characterization is 
inappropriate, as this is a civil action that seeks only compensatory damages for the violation of 
certain of the predicate offenses of Section 2255 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code as set forth in the

First Amended Complaint ("FAC") [D.E. 9]. Accordingly, notice pleading is all that is required. 
Lombard's, Inc. v. Prince Mfg., inc., 753 F.2d 974, 975 (11th Cir. 1985). 
Under notice pleading, the plaintiff need only provide the defendant fair notice of his 
claim and the grounds upon which it rests. See Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 2200 
(2007). 
As this is a liberal pleading requirement, "[ s ]pecific facts are not necessary; the 
statement need only 'give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon 
which it rests."' id. (quoting Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 545 (2007)) (internal 
citation omitted). In considering a motion to dismiss, a court places a "very high burden" on a 
defendant to show that a "plaintiff cannot conceivably prove any set of facts that would entitle 
him to relief." Beck v. Deloitte & Touche et al., 144 F.3d 732, 735-36 (11th Cir. 1998); accord 
H.J. inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 249-50 (1989). 
The FAC satisfies the 
aforementioned pleading requirements. 
J. 
REQUIRING MERGER OF EACH SEPARATE STATUTORY PREDICATE 
OFFENSE INTO ONE SINGLE COUNT WOULD BE IMPROPER. 
A. Pleading of Multiple Counts Under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 Is Proper. 
In his motion, Defendant argues that the multiple counts of the FAC should be merged 
into a single count. Defendant improperly asserts: 
Contrary to Plaintiffs attempt to multiply her recovery by asserting 
six separate counts, [18 U.S.C.] § 2255, creates a single cause of ac-
tion with a single penalty for all violations of a predicate offense, not 
separate causes of action and separate recoveries on a "per violation" 
basis. 
(Motion 34). In so contending, Defendant both confuses and incorrectly advances two distinct 
propositions: first, that pleading a separate count for each violation of a predicate offense as set

forth in Section 2255 of Title 18 is improper; and second, that all violations of a particular 
predicate offense must be pied as a single cause of action to provide for a single recovery, even 
where multiple violations of that particular predicate offense may exist. 
In connection with Defendant's first proposition, a plain reading of Section 2255 
demonstrates that this civil remedies statute applies individually to each numerated predicate 
offense and establishes the minimum amount of civil damages available to a qualifying victim 
for each violation. Specifically, 18 U .S.C. Section 2255 provides: 
(a) In General. - Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a 
violation of section 2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 
2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who suffers personal injury as a 
result of such violation, regardless of whether the injury occurred while 
such person was a minor, may sue in any appropriate United States 
District Court and shall recover the actual damages such person sustains 
and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Any person 
as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained 
damages ofno less than $150,000 in ;,,alue. 1 
18 U.S.C. § 2255(a) (2008). Nowhere does the above statutory text require that the violation of 
the specified federal statutes be pied as a single count. Section 2255 provides a civil remedy for 
a violation of each of the predicate offenses, and does not, as Defendant maintains, preclude 
multiple counts from being pied pursuant to its terms. For each predicate offense that Defendant 
committed, Section 2255 should apply independently and uniquely to properly determine the 
minimum amount of civil damages to be awarded for such offense. To adopt the contrary 
approach is to suggest that a victim of a violation of a single predicate offense receive the same 
compensation as a victim of multiple enumerated predicate offenses. The statute's language, as 
1 July 27, 2006, approximately two years before Defendant pled guilty to state criminal offenses and signed the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement, Public Law 109-248, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Public Safety Act, became 
law and raised the statutory minimum for damages under 18 U.S.C. Section 2255 from $50,000.00 to $150,000.00.

well as principles of equity, provide for recovery for each separate predicate offense; to interpret 
the statute as Defendant proposes would mean that Congress granted defendants who violate a 
predicate offense the ability to violate additional predicate offenses without any accountability. 
This was not Congress' intent. 
The underlying approach to statuto1y interpretation or construction in Flmida is set forth 
inA.R. Douglass, Inc., v. McRainey, 137 So. 157 (Fla. 1931): 
The intention and meaning of the Legislature must primarily be 
detennined from the language of the statute itself and not from 
conjectures aliunde. When the language of the statute is clear and 
unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no 
occasion for resorting to the rules of statutory interpretation and 
construction; the statute must be given its plain and obvious 
meamng. 
Id. at 159. A review of the wording of Section 2255 unambiguously demonstrates that the 
statute provides damages for both multiple violations of a single predicate act' as well as 
multiple violations of separate predicate acts. In its cmTent form, the statute allows "[ a ]ny 
person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section 2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 
2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who suffers personal injury as a 
result of such violation" to recover damages in an amount of not less than $150,000.00. 18 
U.S.C. § 2255(a) (emphasis added). This statute is properly read to apply the damage floor of 
Section 2255 to each violation of a predicate offense. Defendant's assertion that the above 
statute only permits a single recovery based on a single cause of action would require that the 
statute be rewritten to .eliminate the use of the article "a" and to make plural all singular usages 
of the word "violation." 
'See Section I. B. of this Reply in support of the pleading of multiple violations of a predicate offense.

CASE NO.: 09-CV-80591-MARRA/JOHNSON 
The statute, however, was not written in this manner, and where the statute as currently 
constructed is unambiguous in its meaning, judicial interpretation of the statute would be 
improper. See Heredia v. Allstate Insurance Company, 358 So.2d 1353 (Fla. 1978) ( explaining 
that "[ w ]here the words selected by the Legislature are clear and unambiguous ... judicial 
interpretation is not appropriate to displace the expressed intent"). 
In the instant case, where Defendant violated multiple predicate offenses in his sexual 
exploitation of Plaintiff, it is proper to plead each violation as a separate count and seek damages 
under each count in accordance with Section 2255. 
B. Pleading of Multiple Violations of a Predicate Offense Under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 Is 
Proper. 
Defendant continues his self-serving interpretation of Section 2255 through the 
advancement of his second proposition. Similar to the above argument that the violation of 
several predicate offenses should be pied as one count, Defendant argues that, when multiple 
violations of a single predicate offense occur, a victim's recovery on a "per violation" basis is 
prohibited. Again, Defendant's contention fails on the basis of a common sense reading of the 
statute and principles of fairness. Just as it makes no sense to compensate a victim of a violation 
of a single predicate offense with exactly the same amount as a victim of a violation of multiple 
predicate offenses, it is equally unsustainable to argue that a victim of multiple violations of a 
predicate offense should receive the same damage award as a victim of only a single violation of 
that same offense. To maintain otherwise is to eliminate the deterrent value of the statutory 
scheme by allowing a defendant to continue to victimize a child without any additional 
consequences subsequent to such defendant's first violation of the relevant predicate act.

Defendant argues that, "where actual damages were less than [the threshold amount] or 
otherwise impossible to prove, the statute would guarantee a lump-sum, make-whole penalty of 
[the threshold amount] for all injuries sustained as a result of the predicate acts." (Motion 35). 
Defendant fails to provide any support for this contention, either in the case law, legislative 
history, or otherwise. 
First, Defendant incorrectly states the amount of the "make-whole" 
penalty. The statute unambiguously provides that "[a]ny person as described in the preceding 
sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages of no less than [the threshold amount]." 18 
U.S.C. § 2255(a) (2008). As such, the threshold amount is a floor, and not a ceiling, on the 
amount of damages that can be awarded for a violation of each predicate offense. Consequently, 
in the instant case, even if all violations of the predicate offenses, as well as all violations of a 
single predicate offense, were merged into a single cause of action, the recovery would not be 
limited to the minimum threshold damage award. 
Relevant case law provides support for holding Defendant accountable for each time he 
violated any of the enumerated predicate offenses. In United States v. Esch, 832 F.2d 531, 541 
(10th Cir. 1987), the court established that a determination of the correct unit of prosecution for 
violation of a statute "focuses in part on the identification of the key element of the federal 
offense." In Esch, the defendants were convicted on sixteen counts of sexual exploitation of 
children for photographs taken in violation of Title 18, Section 2251 of the U.S. Code. Id. at 
533. The court held that the indictment properly charged separate counts3 for each of the 
photographs produced. Id. at 533, 542. 
Specifically, the court noted that the charging of 
3Note that although Defendaut contends that all predicate violations of predicate offenses, as well as multiple 
violations of a single predicate offense, should be pied as a single cause of action with only a single recovery, Esch 
stauds for the contrary view.

separate offenses was warranted where "[ e Jach photograph depended upon a separate and 
distinct use of the children" in violation of the key element of the offense. Id. at 542; see also 
Ebeling v. Morgan, 237 U.S. 625, 629 (1915) (charging the defendant with a separate count for 
each mail bag cut open in violation of the statutory offense, despite the transaction being "in a 
sense continuous"); United States v. Gallardo, 915 F.2d 149, 151 (5th Cir. 1990) (explaining that 
"each separate use of the mail to transport or ship child pornography should constitute a separate 
crime because it is the act of either transporting or shipping that is the central focus of [18 
U.S.C. § 2252(a)(l)(A), a predicate] statute"). 
Notwithstanding that the foregoing jurispmdence involved criminal prosecution for the 
violation of predicate offenses, because Section 2255 exists to provide civil remedies for those 
predicate offenses, Defendant's contention that a plaintiff seeking recourse under Section 2255 
cannot assert a claim on a "per violation" basis is without merit. It is simply illogical to assert, 
as Defendant does, that multiple counts and violations can be charged in the criminal context, 
but that, in a civil action under Section 2255 for those same violations, all counts and violations 
must be lumped together as one with a single penalty. 
Multiple counts are proper, as shown, for example, in Tilton v. Playboy Entertainment 
Group, Inc., 554 F.3d 1371, 1375 (11th Cir. 2009), on which Defendant relies in his Motion. 
(Motion 34). In Tilton, the court did not prohibit the plaintiff from seeking separate damages 
against several defendants based on a single incident for violations of three predicate offenses 
under Section 2255: §§ 2251(a), 2252(a), and 2252(A)(a). Id. Although the counts brought 
under Sections 2252(a) and 2252(A) were deemed to be duplicative by the court and thus were 
merged, the plaintiff was, nevertheless, able to recover on the two remaining counts and was

awarded civil damages for each pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2255. Furthermore, Defendant's 
reliance on Tilton to claim that multiple alleged violations of a single predicate offense have 
never been allowed is misplaced; this case involved only a single violation of a predicate statute. 
Moreover, Defendant's reliance on its own Doe vs. Epstein line of cases is, at a minimum, 
premature. 
Accordingly, in the instant case, not only was it proper for Plaintiff to plead multiple 
counts in the PAC for the violation of each predicate statute identified therein, but also, this 
Court should assess civil damages under Section 2255 for each violation of a particular predicate 
statute. Defendant's argument is unsupported by case law and is nothing more than a blatant 
attempt to limit Plaintiffs potential recovery as a victim of Defendant's multiple acts of sexual 
exploitation and abuse.
