PLAINTIFFS JANE DOE NO. 101 and JANE DOE NO. 102'S 
MOTION FOR NO-CONTACT ORDER 
Plaintiffs, Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 (together, the "Plaintiffs") hereby 
move this Court for a No-Contact Order directed to Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, and, as grounds, 
state as follows: 
1. 
After investigations by the Palm Beach Police Department, the Palm Beach State 
Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney's Office 
for the Southern District of Florida (the "USAO"), Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, in June 2008, 
entered pleas of "guilty" in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach Count, Florida, to 
various Florida state crimes involving the solicitation of minors for prostitution and the 
procurement of minors for the purposes of prostitution. 
2. 
During the course of Defendant's state plea conference of June 30, 2008, Palm 
Beach Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo ordered Defendant "not to have any contact, 
direct or indirect'' with any victims. (Transcript of the Plea Conference at 20, relevant pages 
attached hereto as Exhibit A). Judge Dale Pucillo went on to clarify that, by "indirect," she 
meant that Defendant should not send any text messages, e-mails, Facebook contact, My Space 
contact, telephone calls, voicemails, or messages through third parties to "any of these victims." 
Id. Judge Dale Pucillo expressly stated that the no-contact order should apply to "all of the 
victims." Id. 
3. 
In addition, after Defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the 
USAO, Assistant United States Attorney Marie Villafana provided Defendant's attorneys with a 
list of individuals whom the USAO had identified as victims of child sex exploitation as defined 
in 18 U.S.C. § 2255 (the "USAO List"). The USAO was prepared to indict Defendant based 
upon Defendant's sexual exploitation of these minor victims. It was the intent of the USAO to 
place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been had Defendant been

convicted at trial. Thus, upon information and belief, AUSA Marie Villafana and Mr. Michael 
Tein, former counsel for Defendant, along with Mr. Jack Goldberger, who still represents 
Defendant, entered into a verbal agreement at the time AUSA Villafana provided the USAO List 
to them, whereby neither Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, nor his agents would have any direct or 
indirect contact with the victims named on the USAO List. 
4. 
Nevertheless, during a March 25th meeting with Defendant's counsel, Defendant's 
counsel told Plaintiffs' counsel that it is Defendant's position that the no-contact order agreed to 
during the state plea conference does not apply to anyone other than those three victims who 
were officially part of Defendant's state plea. 
5. 
Upon Plaintiffs' counsel seeking reassurance from Defendant's counsel that 
neither Defendant nor his agents would contact victims on the USAO List, Defendant's counsel 
responded that Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, would not contact any of undersigned counsel's 
clients as long as Mr. Josefsberg was representing them in connection with settlement 
discussions. 
6. 
As a result, on April 17, 2009, Plaintiffs' counsel sent defense counsel a letter 
requesting that Defendant provide written confirmation that neither he nor his agents will 
directly or indirectly contact any of the victims represented by Plaintiffs' counsel (the "No-
Contact Letter") (April 17, 2009 Letter attached hereto as Exhibit B). On May 18, 2009, 
Plaintiffs' counsel again requested this written confirmation (E-mail correspondence attached 
hereto as Exhibit C). 
Despite Plaintiffs' reasonable requests, Defendant's counsel first 
responded by stating that the Non-Prosecution Agreement does not prevent some form of contact 
with undersigned counsel's clients. (Redacted May 18, 2009 Letter from Mr. Robert Critton is 
attached hereto as Exhibit D). Defendant's counsel then sent a letter on May 21, 2009 citing the 
Comment to Rule 4-4.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct that states that "[p ]arties to a matter

may communicate directly with each other." (Redacted May 21, 2009 Letter from Mr. Critton is 
attached hereto as Exhibit E). Thus, despite Mr. Critton's statement that it is not Defendant's 
intention to have direct contact with undersigned counsel's clients, Defendant obviously believes 
he can change his intentions if he so chooses. 
7. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is a designated sexual offender who sexually abused 
Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 when the victims were minors. As a result of his abuse, 
Plaintiffs have in the past suffered, now suffer, and will in the future continue to suffer, physical 
injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, psychological and/or psychiatric trauma, mental 
anguish, humiliation, confusion, embarrassment, loss of educational opportunities, loss of self-
esteem, loss of dignity, and invasion of their privacy. Any further direct or indirect contact with 
Defendant and/or his agents would cause a great deal of additional damages. Moreover, any 
desire or need on the part of Defendant to contact these victims-implied by virtue of his refusal 
to tmambiguously confirm that he will not contact them-is disturbing and suspect, at best. At a 
minimum, Defendant's refusal to avoid contaet works as a ploy to attempt to keep Plaintiffs in 
"victim mode." 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court to enter an order prohibiting 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, and any of his agents from any direct or indirect contact with 
Plaintiffs, except through Plaintiffs' attorney ofrecord through the duration of this Court's order. 
Memorandum In Sugport 
As previously stated, during the course of Defendant's state plea conference of June 30, 
2008, Palm Beach Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo ordered Defendant "not to have any 
contact, direct or indirect" with any of Defendant's victims. However, for what could only be 
dubious purposes, Defendant seeks to take advantage of the fact that only three of Defendant's 
numerous victims were officially a part of the State of Florida's criminal prosecution of

Defendant and that he entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the USAO. Thus, despi1 
the no-contact order being considered a standard condition of probation or community contrc 
for sex offenders such as Defendant, and despite his counsel having agreed to a no-contact orde 
with AUSA Villafana for all of Defendant's victims on the USAO List, Defendant is now takin: 
the position that neither Judge Dale Pucillo's no-contact order nor his agreement with the USA( 
via his counsel restricts him from contacting any of the victims except for the three victim 
directly involved in the state plea. Because of the non-prosecution agreement, there is no federa 
conviction against Defendant with respect to Plaintiffs and other victims on the USAO List wh< 
are similarly situated and, thus, no accompanying sentencing court to issue a no-contact order 
However, each of the victims on the USAO List is supposed to be in the same position as iJ 
Defendant had been convicted in federal court. In crimes involving victims, at the time oJ 
sentencing, a sentencing judge generally has wide discretion to order that the defendant have no 
contact with the victim or victims of the crime or crimes for which the defendant is being 
sentenced. Where the defendant is given a sentence of probation or community control, the no-
contact order can be made a condition of the defendant's supervision. The case for judicial 
intervention is heightened in cases such as this one, where Defendant has sexually exploited 
numerous minors. Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102, like all of the other young women 
on the USAO List, were sexually abused by Defendant; any further direct contact with 
Defendant and/or his agents would cause a great deal of additional damages. Previous contact by 
Defendant and his agents with other victims has had a temole effect on the young women's 
ability to heal the scars of Defendant's abuse. Additionally, Defendant's contacting his victims 
also has the predictable effect of undermining the victims' willingness to proceed with their civil 
actions against Defendant. Defendant's demonstrated use of his wealth, power, and influence 
has the immediate effect of intimidating young women who have already been traumatized by

his sexual exploitation. 
Indeed, any desire or need on the part of Defendant to contact his 
victims, implied by virtue of his refusal to confirm that he will not contact them directly or 
indirectly, is disturbing and suspect, at best. 
Plaintiffs thus ask this Court to provide the 
protection and peace of mind that each of them needs.

Plaintiffs' Motion for No-Contact Order prohibiting Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, from any

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We have done our due 
diligence, for what it's worth, there is a 
residential street. 
There are not children 
congregating on that street. 
We think the 
address applies, if it doesn't, we fully 
recognize that he can't live there. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Dis, you shall 
not have any contact with the victim, are 
there more than one victim? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
There's several. 
THE COURT: 
Several, all of the 
victims. 
So this should be plural. 
I'm 
making that plural. 
You are not to have 
any contact direct or indirect, and in this 
day and age I find it necessary to go over 
exactly what we mean by indirect. 
By 
indirect, we mean no text messages, no 
e~mail, no Face Book, no My Space, no 
telephone calls, no voice mails, no

messages through carrier pigeon, no 
messages through third parties, no hey 
would you tell so and so for me, no having 
a friend, acquaintance or stranger approach 
any of these victims with a message of any 
sort from you, is that clear? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am 
THE COURT: 
And then it states, 
unless approved by the victim, the 
therapist and the sentencing court. 
Okay. 
THE DEFENDANT: 
I understand. 
THE COURT: 
And the sentencing court. 
So, if there is a desire which, I would 
think would be a bit strange to have 
contact with any of the victims the court 
must approve it. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
If the victim was under 
the age of 18, which was the case, you 
shall not until you have successfully 
attended and completed the sex offender 
program. 
So, is this sex offender 9rogram 
becoming a condition of probation? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
That is not. 
I 
don't believe I circled that one.

Of Counsel 
During om-recent meeting with Mr. Black, we were told that it is your client's position that 
the no-contact order agreed to during the state plea colloquy does not apply to any of our clients 
except for those victims who were part of Mr. Epstein's state plea Our understanding is that AUSA 
Villafana and Messrs. Tein and Goldberger entered a verbal agreement at the time that the list of 
victims was provided to those defense counsel.that Mr. Epstein, including his agents, would have· 
no direct or indirect contact with the victims named on this list . In addiditon, under applicable 
Florida Bar Rules governing contact by attorneys and their agents with persons represented by 
counsel, any contact with any of our clients or their family members by Mr. Epstein, his counsel 
and/or his agents must strictly be through us. Mr. Lefkowitz had previously reassured us that .Mr. 
Epstein would not contact any of our clients as long as I am "representing them in connection with 
settlement discussions." Due to om differences regarding the retroactivity issue and 1he "per 
plaintiff' v. per incident/count issue, we have apparently reached a dead end regarding settlement

We are concerned that Mr. Epstein could misconstrue our impasse in conjunction with Mr. 
Lefkowitz' e-mail to mean that now that we are no longer "representing them in connection with 
settlement discussions," he may contact them. Please be assured that it is our position that regardless 
of whether we are representing our clients during settJement discussions and/or trial preparation, we, 
and the rules of professional conduct, prohibit contact. 
In order to be crystal clear as to whom we represent, we have attached a list of our present 
clients. We expect each member of Mr. Epstein's defense team to abide by the applicable rules of 
professional conduct We request written confirmation from Mr. Epstein that neither he nor his 
agents will contact any of the victims represented by us. 
If this correspondence is in any way unclear, please contact us. 
Sincerely,

Ol'COUNSEL 
As I advised you yesterday, I am responding to your April 17, 2009 letter. As l 
stated in my e-tnail, I think your request is unnecessary. Despite what Roy may have 
said to you, my client has had no contact with any of your clients. To my knowledge, 
the only one who has "breachedff any agreement regarding contact is your own client, 
-
who, as I advised you in a letter last week, contacted Jack Goldberger's 
office looking for her settlement check. Mr. Goldberger, of course, did not speak with 
her. 
Lawyers who represent Mr. Epstein are well familiar with the Rules of 
Professional Conduct, including Rule 4-4.2. At the same time, I am certain you are 
equally familiar with that Rule. 
The Comment provides «Parties to a matter may 
communicate directly with each other ... ". 
To my knowledge, neither Mr. Epstein nor any attorney or agent of those 
attorneys who represent Mr. Epstein, have contacted or attempted to contact your 
clients. Given that it is not Mr. Epstein's Intention to have direct contact with your 
clients, it is unnecessary to respond point by point to statements attributed to my co--
counsel.

Rather than to be concerned about what my client is doing, I would ask that you 
advise your clients not to contact Mr. Epstein's lawyers dfrectly. Neither I nor the 
attorneys who represent Mr. Epstein want to be put in a position where we are set up by 
any of your clients.
