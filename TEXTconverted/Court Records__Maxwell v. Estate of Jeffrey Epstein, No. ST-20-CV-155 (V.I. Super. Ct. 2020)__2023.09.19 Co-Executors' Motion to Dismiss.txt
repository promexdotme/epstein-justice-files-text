Plaintiff Ghislaine Maxwell (“Maxwell”) brings this action against Defendants seeking 
common law and contractual indemnification for attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred in 
unsuccessfully defending herself in a criminal prosecution brought in the Southern District of New 
York.  On September 7, 2022, the Court permitted Maxwell’s counsel to withdraw and ordered 
Maxwell to obtain new counsel within 60 days, and entered a stay of the proceedings.  Maxwell 
did not obtain new counsel within the designated period, nor in the following four months.  At a 
hearing on March 17, 2023, Maxwell was again ordered to obtain new counsel within 60 days, but 
again failed to do so then or in the months following.   Despite the Court’s order and despite that 
she, as the plaintiff, initiated this action, Maxwell has not obtained new counsel and has not entered 
her appearance pro se.  Her refusal to follow court orders and to prosecute this case warrants 
dismissal pursuant to Virgin Islands Rule of Procedure 41(b).  Specifically, under the factors 
articulated by the Virgin Islands Supreme Court in Halliday v. Footlocker Specialty, Inc., 53 V.I. 
505, 510 (V.I. 2010), the Court should dismiss Maxwell’s claim because: (1) Maxwell is 
personally responsible for obtaining counsel in this matter; (2) Defendants are prejudiced by 
Maxwell’s dilatory conduct as it has stalled this action for over a year; (3) Maxwell has a history 
of dilatory conduct as she has now disregarded two Court orders; (4) Maxwell’s conduct is willful 
as she is aware of the Court’s orders and has neither followed them nor, if she cannot afford new 
counsel, appeared pro se; (5) dismissal is an appropriate sanction; and (6) Maxwell’s 
indemnification claims fail on their face.  Thus, for the reasons set forth in this brief, the Court 
should dismiss the Complaint under Rule 41(b) or order her to appear pro se within 30 days so that 
the case may proceed.   
BACKGROUND 

3 
 
 
 
On March 12, 2020, Maxwell instituted this action against the Estate and NES, seeking 
contractual and common law indemnification of attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred as a result 
of her criminal prosecution in the Southern District of New York.  Maxwell alleges that these costs 
were incurred “by reason of her prior employment relationship with Jeffrey E. Epstein and his 
affiliated businesses.”  Compl. ¶ 1.  On May 1, 2020, the Estate and NES moved to dismiss 
Maxwell’s complaint pursuant to Virgin Islands Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because (1) 
Maxwell’s claim against the Co-Executors was premature; and (2) Maxwell’s indemnification 
claims are barred by NES’s 2014 operating agreement.  On June 1, 2020, the parties jointly moved 
for a stay of the action until the statutory one-year waiting period elapsed on September 7, 2020.  
The Court granted the parties’ motion, and a stay was entered.  The stay was lifted on September 
8, 2020, and Maxwell filed her opposition to the motion to dismiss.  On September 11, 2020, the 
Co-Executors of the Estate formally rejected Maxwell’s claim for indemnification.  Subsequently, 
Defendants filed a reply in support of their motion to dismiss, arguing that Maxwell’s claims for 
indemnification were unripe until judgments were rendered in the civil and criminal actions 
pending against her in New York, as indemnity would not apply if judgment were rendered against 
her.   
On December 29, 2021, a jury found Maxwell guilty of multiple crimes, including 
conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transportation of 
a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, and sex trafficking of an individual under 
the age of eighteen.  U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan sentenced Maxwell to 20 years in prison 
followed by five years of supervised release, and ordered Maxwell to pay a fine of $750,000 for 

4 
 
 
these offenses.1  During the sentencing proceeding, Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s argument 
that she was being punished for Epstein’s actions, stating that the evidence at trial established that 
Maxwell “was instrumental in the abuse of several underage girls,” and that Maxwell was “not 
punished in place of Epstein . . . Ms. Maxwell is being punished for the role that she played.”2   
 
On July 1, 2022, the Court requested additional briefing on the Defendants’ motion to 
dismiss the complaint in this action. Specifically, the Court sought further briefing on the 
Defendants’ argument that Maxwell’s common law and contractual indemnification claims were 
barred by public policy in light of her criminal convictions.  In accordance with the Court’s order, 
Defendants further briefed the issue, and Maxwell filed a response.  Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) 
motion to dismiss remains pending before this Court.   
Subsequently, Maxwell’s attorney moved to withdraw as counsel from this proceeding.  
The Court granted the motion on September 7, 2022, ordered Maxwell to obtain new counsel 
within 60 days, and entered a stay.  Maxwell failed to comply with the Court’s order.  At a hearing 
on March 17, 2023, Maxwell was again ordered to obtain new counsel within 60 days.  She has 
again failed to do so.   Maxwell’s failure to comply with the Court’s orders warrants dismissal 
pursuant to Rule 41(b) or, at a minimum, the issuance of an order compelling her to appear pro se 
so that the motion to dismiss can be resolved.

ARGUMENT 
 
Maxwell’s counsel withdrew from his representation over one year ago, and since that time, 
this case has lain dormant.  Though the Court has granted her ample time to find new counsel and 
ordered her to do so, Maxwell has not done so.  Additionally, to the extent Maxwell is unable to 
retain new counsel, nothing precludes her from litigating her claims pro se, but she has thus far 
declined to do so.  Accordingly, the Court should dismiss Maxwell’s Complaint pursuant to Rule 
41(b).   
Under Rule 41(b), dismissal is warranted if the “plaintiff fails to prosecute or to comply 
with these rules or a court order.”   In weighing dismissal under Rule 41(b), the trial court considers 
six factors: “(1) the extent of the party’s personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the adversary 
caused by the failure to meet scheduling orders and respond to discovery; (3) a history of 
dilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct of the party or the attorney was willful or in bad faith; (5) the 
effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which entails an analysis of alternative sanctions; 
and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim or defense.”  Halliday v. Footlocker Specialty, Inc., 53 
V.I. 505, 510 (V.I. 2010).  The court does not have to conclude that all six factors weigh against 
the opposing party in order to find that dismissal is warranted.  Nolasco Comms., Inc. v. Bonneville 
Grp. V.I. Corp., No. SX-15-CV-0220, 2019 WL 937584, at *1 (V.I. Super. Ct. Jan. 28, 2019).   
Here, all six factors weigh in favor of dismissal:  (1) Maxwell is personally responsible for 
obtaining counsel in this matter or, if she lacks the resources to do so, entering an appearance pro 
se; (2) Defendants are prejudiced by Maxwell’s dilatory conduct as it has stalled this action for 
over a year; (3) Maxwell has a history of dilatory conduct in that she has now disregarded two of 
the Court’s orders; (4) Maxwell’s conduct is willful as she is aware of the Court’s orders and 
disregarded them; (5) dismissal is an appropriate sanction under the circumstances; and (6) 

6 
 
 
Maxwell’s indemnification claims fail on their face.  Accordingly, the Court should dismiss 
Maxwell’s Complaint.  
1. Maxwell Is Personally Responsible for Obtaining Counsel or Appearing Pro Se.  
As a litigant, Maxwell is responsible for retaining her own counsel or, if she is without the 
means to engage counsel, to move forward on a pro se basis.  Where the plaintiff is personally 
responsible for failing to comply with a Court order rather than her attorney, this factor weighs in 
favor of dismissal.  Carroll v. Sharkey, No. ST-18-CV-212, 2020 WL 8457889, at *2 (V.I. Super. 
Ct. Jan. 21, 2020); Nolasco Comms., Inc., 2019 WL 937584, at *2.  There is no question that 
Maxwell is ultimately responsible for securing representation in this matter.  Additionally, as 
evidenced by the docketed notice of receipt and her presence at the March 17, 2023 hearing, 
Maxwell is aware of her previous counsel’s withdrawal and the Court’s orders directing her to 
obtain new counsel.  Nonetheless, she has failed to comply and has made no attempt to appear pro 
se.3  Thus, this factor weighs in favor of dismissal.   
2. Defendants Are Prejudiced by Maxwell’s Dilatory Conduct.  
Maxwell’s dilatory conduct is prejudicial to Defendants.  “Prejudice to the opposing party 
is generally demonstrated by either increased expense to the opposing party arising from the extra 
costs associated with filings responding to dilatory behavior or increased difficulty in the opposing 
parties’ ability to present or defend their claim(s) due to the improper behavior.”  Hassan v. 
Brian/Bryan Bishop, No. SX-2017-CV-302, 2023 WL 3246697, at *3 (V.I. Super. Ct. May 1, 
 
3 The Rules make clear that Maxwell is responsible for informing the Court whether she wishes to 
proceed pro se. Rule 3-1(c) provides that if a party’s representation changes, either by obtaining 
new counsel or proceeding on a pro se basis, the party “is personally responsible” for alerting the 
court when such changes occur by filing a notice with updated contact information.  Though 
Maxwell’s counsel did so on withdrawal in this matter, it does not excuse Maxwell from keeping 
the Court appraised of her intentions to prosecute her claims.     

7 
 
 
2023) (quoting Molloy v. Independence Blue Cross, 56 V.I. 155, 189 (V.I. 2012)).  Here, 
Maxwell’s failure to follow the Court’s orders and either retain new counsel or appear pro se has 
resulted in a one-year delay in this matter.  Maxwell’s claims arise from events that occurred dating 
back to 2009.  See Compl. ¶ 19.  As time passes, evidence could be lost, memories will fade, and 
witnesses may become unavailable.  If Maxwell is permitted to further delay this case, it will make 
it more difficult for Defendants to refute her claims.  Moreover, Defendants, as Co-Executors to 
the Estate, are seeking to complete probate and to bring the Estate to a close.  While this matter 
remains pending, the Co-Executors are barred from doing so.  As such, this factor weighs in favor 
of dismissal.   
3. Maxwell Has a History of Dilatoriness. 
Maxwell has a history of dilatoriness as evidenced by her two-time failure to comply with 
the Court’s orders.  Indeed, where a litigant has failed to respond to multiple court orders, courts 
have concluded there is a history of dilatoriness that warrants dismissal.  Carroll, 2020 WL 
8457889, at *3.  Maxwell has now disregarded two court orders and has taken no action to 
prosecute her claim since September 2022.  As a result, this case has been stagnant for more than 
a year.  Therefore, Maxwell’s history of dilatory conduct warrants dismissal.  
4. Maxwell’s Conduct is Willful.   
Maxwell’s failure to comply with the Court’s orders is willful, which weighs in favor of 
dismissal.  Willful or bad faith conduct is “deliberate and contumacious.”  Nolasco Comms. Inc., 
2019 WL 937584, at *2.  As discussed, Maxwell is aware of the Court’s orders and has not 
complied, requested additional time to comply, or taken any steps to appear pro se.   This 
demonstrates that her failure to comply with the Court’s orders is willful.  See Carroll, 2020 WL 
8457889, at *3 (finding that the plaintiff’s conduct was willful where the plaintiff failed to retain 

8 
 
 
new counsel or appear pro se seven months after being ordered to do so).  Even if her failure to 
obtain new counsel is due to her incarceration, nothing prevents Maxwell from entering an 
appearance and litigating her claims pro se.  See id.; Johnson v. Johnson, 14 V.I. 466, 471 (D.V.I. 
1977) (noting that individuals have a constitutional right to represent themselves).  Nonetheless, 
she has not done so and has instead disregarded the Court’s orders and let her action languish at 
the expense of Defendants.  Thus, this factor weighs in favor of dismissal.  
5. Dismissal Is an Appropriate Sanction for Maxwell’s Failure to Comply with the 
Court’s Orders.  
Dismissal is an appropriate sanction for Maxwell’s failure to comply with the Court orders 
because alternative sanctions would not be effective in this matter.  Alternate sanctions typically 
considered by courts include “excluding evidence, precluding witnesses, striking portions of the 
pleadings, or imposing monetary sanctions.”  Hassan, 2023 WL 3246697, at *3.  However, where 
there is “a lack[] of clear interest on Plaintiff’s part to pursue [her] case,” other sanctions are not 
appropriate, and dismissal is warranted.  Id.; see also O’Brien v. Gov’t of the V.I., No. 2007-35, 
2011 WL 2650637, at *4 (D.V.I. July 6, 2011) (“Where as here, a party, rather than an attorney, 
is the cause of undue delay, alternative sanctions often prove unsuccessful.”).  Here, Maxwell has 
been granted ample time to retain new counsel or to prosecute her claim pro se.  Her failure to do 
so demonstrates a lack of interest on her part to pursue her claims.  Accordingly, this factor weighs 
in favor of dismissal.  
6. Maxwell’s Contractual and Common Law Indemnification Claims Fail on the 
Merits.  
Finally, because Maxwell’s common law and contractual indemnification claims are not 
viable, her Complaint should be dismissed.  “A claim, or defense, will be deemed meritorious 
when the allegations of the pleadings, if established at trial, would support recovery by plaintiff or 

9 
 
 
would constitute a complete defense.”  Hassan, 2023 WL 3246697, at *4.  As briefed in 
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and Supplemental Brief in Support of the Motion to Dismiss, both 
contractual and common law indemnification for individuals convicted of intentional criminal 
conduct violates public policy because it would promote illegality and allow wrongdoers to cause 
injury with impunity.  Courts across the country routinely hold that contractual indemnification 
for those found guilty of intentional criminal acts is unenforceable as against public policy.   See, 
e.g., Homesite Ins. Co. of the Midwest v. Frost, No. CV 20-00024-M-DLC, 2020 WL 5369847, at 
*5 (D. Mont. Sept. 8, 2020) (“in Montana there is an unmistakable public policy against . . . 
indemnification for criminal acts.”); CSX Transp., Inc. v. Gen. Mills, Inc., No. 1:14-CV-201-TWT, 
2019 BL 223294, at *11 (N.D. Ga. Jun. 14, 2019) (“if the Plaintiff is ultimately found to have been 
criminally negligent, then public policy would preclude indemnification.”); Utica First Ins. Co. v. 
Maclean, No. CIV.A. 08-1138, 2009 WL 415988, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 19, 2009) (“[r]equiring an 
insurance company to defend or indemnify its insured for . . . criminal acts would also violate 
public policy in Pennsylvania.”); BDO Seidman, LLP v. Harris, 379 Ill. App. 3d 918, 925 (Ill. 
App. Ct. 2008) (“[t]aken together, the stipulation of facts pursuant to the PTD agreement shows 
that plaintiff engaged in conduct which constituted misprision of felony by knowingly concealing 
the felony fraud of its client, SBU. Under New York public policy. . . indemnification for such 
criminal conduct is barred by public policy.”); Equitex, Inc. v. Ungar, 60 P.3d 746, 750 (Colo. 
App. 2002) (“[p]ublic policy prohibits indemnifying a party for damages resulting from intentional 
or willful wrongful acts.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). See, e.g., 42 C.J.S. Indemnity § 8 
(“a contract or bond by which one party undertakes to indemnify the other against the 
consequences of an illegal act is generally held illegal and void.”).  The Court should follow this 
well-established principle and reject Maxwell’s contractual indemnity claim.   

10 
 
 
Additionally, the public policy concerns that bar enforcement of contractual 
indemnification for those convicted of intentional criminal acts apply with equal force to common 
law indemnification claims or indemnification based on promissory estoppel.  Both of these are 
equitable doctrines. See, e.g., Willie v. Amerada Hess Corp., 66 V.I. 23, 46 (V.I. Super. Ct. 2017) 
(“[t]he right to indemnity . . . is a common law equitable remedy . . . .”); Appleton v. Harrigan, 
No. ST-10-CV-275, 2012 WL 13219651, at *5 (V.I. Super. Ct. Dec. 6, 2012) (“[l]ike a claim of 
unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel is an equitable remedy.”).  Equity does not condone a 
criminal actor receiving financial immunity from the consequences of her crimes.  Indemnification 
based on either promissory estoppel or common law is not viable (and violates public policy) 
where, as here, the indemnitee has been convicted of an intentional criminal act.  Courts cannot 
enforce a judgment upholding a[n] agreement in law or in equity that is against public policy.”  
Cruse v. Callwood, 55 V.I. 999, 1003 (D.V.I. 2010) (parties to a pyramid scheme cannot recover 
on a theory of restitution when they were aware of the nature of the scheme); see also, e.g., Willie, 
66 V.I. at 92 (Virgin Islands recognizes common law indemnification “where an innocent party is 
held vicariously liable for the actions of the true tortfeasor”) (emphasis in original); Equitex, 60 
P.3d at 750 (rejecting a promissory estoppel claim for indemnification because “equitable 
doctrines such as promissory estoppel may not be used to enforce an agreement in favor of a 
wrongdoer”).  Accordingly, Maxwell’s common law indemnification claims are similarly 
precluded by her criminal conviction.  Thus, the final factor weighs in favor of dismissal.  
CONCLUSION  
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should dismiss the Complaint.  In the alternative, if 
the Court is not inclined to dismiss the Complaint, Maxwell should be ordered to appear pro se 
within 30 days or face dismissal of the Complaint.
