3? 
A 
This is a photograph of 
IF with 
her date of birth, 
Q 
Now you mentioned that in March of 2004 
and April of 2004, there are these records of 
phone calls and did 
say how old she was 
when she first went to Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
I'm sorry. Did 
say how old she 
was? 
Q 
Did she tell you or the police officers 
how old she was? 
A 
Yes. 
I'm sorry. 
I thought your 
question was did she tell Mr. Epstein. 
She told me that she was 16 when she 
went to Mr. Epstein's house. 
Q 
Okay. That is consistent with those 
phones calls? 
A 
Yes, it is. 
Q 
Okay. Now during her first visit with 
Mr. Epstein, what happened? 
A 
She went to Mr. Epstein's house.

her driver's license at that time, which she told

her she got her driver's license when she was 17. 
So 
drove her to Mr. Epstein's 
house. She provided Mr. Epstein with a few 
massages. She remained clothed both times that 
she gave him a massage. 
At this time, she kept 
her clothes on. 
I think one time she was wearing shorts 
and a T-shirt, maybe the second time she was 
wearing jeans and a T-shirt. That he constantly 
grabbed and pulled at her during the massage 
trying to draw her closer to him, but at that 
time, you know, there was no sexual activity other 
than the grabbing and pulling. 
There was no sexual activity that took 
place on those first couple of massages, and she 
remained clothed at that time. 
Q 
Now after those first few massages, was 
there a break in time before 
returns to 
the Epstein house? 
A 
told us that she and 
had 
had some kind of a

so there was a time 
period where she did not go back to Mr. Epstein's 
house.

when she returned to the Epstein house? 
A 
Yes. 
We have phone activity between 
and 
II. beginning in December 
of '04. 
Q 
And how old was 
I. in December 
of '04? 
A 
She had turned 17 at that time. 
In 
fact, through the course of the phone records 
beginning in December of '04 to October of 2005, 
we have over 150 phone calls between 
Z. 
and 
, Mr. Epstein's assistant. 
Q 
What did 
Z. tell you about the 
activity that occurred when she started returning 
in late '04? 
A 
When she started giving Mr. Epstein 
massages after that break, the massages became 
much more sexual in nature. Mr. Epstein continued 
to push and there were many times when 
would perform massages completely nude. 
Several times, she would stay in her 
underwear with no bra on, but stated to me that 
many occasions she performed the massages to Mr. 
Epstein in the nude. 
Q 
In addition to being unclothed, was 
there other sexual activity?

Now when was 
first interviewed 
by the Palm Beach Police? 
A 
She was interviewed October 6th of 2005. 
Q 
And at that time, did she say when her 
last visit was to Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
Yes, she said October 1st, 2005, was the 
last massage that she had given Mr. Epstein. 
Q 
Is there any other evidence that was 
recovered from Mr. Epstein's or his household 
items that would confirm that statement? 
A 
We have a message pad. During the 
search warrant, several of the message pads -- I 
don't know if we referred to them at this stage. 
We may not have. 
We recovered -- well, I shouldn't say 
we, the Palm Beach Police Department recovered 
several message pads. They were carbon copy 
message pads. 
So we have several of those books from 
their search warrant and in there, there is a 
message on October 1st confirming 
appointment for the massage as well as another

them on that same day.

Q 
All right. 
When 
was interviewed

by the Palm Beach Police Department, did she 
15 describe all of the sexual activity?

So we took a little bit of a break, but 
then she was able to say that Mr. Epstein had 
provided her as a birthday present a 
. 
So 
not only was there a 
used 
on her, but at this time 
and I think that's 
kind of what got 
talking about the sexual 
activity that she was able to tell me that, and 
she was very, very embarrassed, but that Mr. 
Epstein had given her for her eighteenth birthday 
a 
Q 
Now you mentioned that that happened on 
her eighteenth birthday?

Yes.

Epstein knew it was her eighteenth birthday?

She stated that Mr. Epstein provided to 
her on her eighteenth birthday the

So before you had said that 
had 
instructed 
to tell everyone that she was 
18; do you remember that?

Her birthday was coming up.

And at some point, was a car provided 
for 
A 
Yes. 
In October of '05, 
was 
having 
asked Mr. Epstein is she could 
borrow one of his cars to go to Orlando and he 
stated that -- at first he said yes, and then he 
said he would get her a rental car. 
So 
contacted 
a few days 
later and said that a car had been rented for 
and that the house manager used the 
company credit card and 
picked up that 
car, and actually when the police interviewed her 
on October 6th, which was five or six days after 
the last massage, they were able to see that that 
Nissan Sentra that had been rented by Mr. Epstein, 
had that in her possession for at least 
through January 1st of 2006 and that car was 
rented by Mr. Epstein for at least that amount of 
time. 
Q 
Did 
describe how the massage 
appointments would be made?

Yes, she did.

Okay. 
And what did she say were some of 
the topics of discussion?

Mr. Epstein asked her questions about 
herself, asked her if she was a

she was going to school.

she would be attending college at

So that was a 
- but that was her future 
plan? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
So in other words, did Mr. Epstein know 
that she was in high school at the time? 
A 
Yes, he did. And the Palm Beach Police 
asked 
if Jeffrey knew her age and 
told the Palm Beach Police Department, he didn't 
care what my age was. 
Q 
Now did 
describe either to you 
or to the police department how she would be paid 
for these massages?

A 
She stated she was paid $200 and that 
she received anywhere from two to $300. 
Q 
With every visit? 
A 
With each visit. 
Q 
Okay. Did she say who would provide her 
with that money? 
A 
She said that Jeffrey paid her at the 
end of the massage. 
Q 
All right. 
You mentioned the gift of 
the vibrator. Were there other gifts that were 
given to 
A 
Yes. The time period is unclear, but 
the 
was given to her for her eighteenth 
birthday. There were three sets of bra and 
underwear, panties, Victoria Secret bra and 
underwear sets that were also given to 
as 
gifts from Mr. Epstein. 
Q 
Now I know that we talked earlier about 
the fact that 
is the person who brought 
to Mr. Epstein's house. Did 
ever 
bring anyone to Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
brought a female by the name of

took her there in the spring of

2005 and 
was 18 at that time.

Q 
Now can you tell us now 
went
9 
about bringing 
to the house? 
10 
A 
told 
that she could make 
11 
some money giving a massage to Mr. Epstein and 
12 
and 
went to Mr. Epstein's house 
13 
together. 
14 
The first time that 
went there, 
15 she did not go upstairs and give him a massage. 
16 
was working that day. 
But in talking to 
17 
further, 
stated that she probably 
18 over the period of time between the spring of '05 
19 
and October of '05, performed around five to ten 
20 
massages for Mr. Epstein. 
21 
The first few of those he did not do 
22 anything as far as no 
no sexual 
23 activity. She would just perform a massage. 
24 
Q 
And did that change over time? 
25 
A 
Yes, it did. 
She stated that she

performed two to three massages out of those five 
or ten and in her underwear and bra only, and 
that he would push her each time. 
He would just push her to do more and on 
the third -- I believe she stated the third or 
fourth massage, he told her that she could make 
more money if she removed her clothing, because 
she stayed clothed during the first few massages, 
and she was paid $200 for each of those massages. 
On the third or fourth massage, Mr. 
Epstein said that she could make more money if she 
removed her clothing. So around the fourth or 
fifth time, she did start taking off her clothing 
down to her underwear and bra only. 
Q 
And then what happened when she was at 
that point of being unclothed? 
A 
She would perform the massage. He 
attempted to touch her, but she always would say 
no. 
At one point, her bra does get undone by Mr. 
Epstein, but she does keep it up. 
Q 
Now that was the extent of his touching 
At some point, did he 
in front of her? 
A 
Yes, he did. 
Not in the very beginning, 
but throughout this he did. Now I should tell you

that 
stated to us that because she was kind 
of reserved or held back as he made advances 
towards her, she was able to see Mr. Epstein's 
and that he 
but that he 
, that he 
. 
She did 
not feel that Mr. Epstein liked her very much. 
Q 
But just to sort of compare what 
said with what 
said, they both said that 
at the beginning they remained clothed? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And that Mr. Epstein progressively 
pushed and pushed and pushed for more sexual 
activity? 
A 
Yes.

pull there was a message and that was found and it 
stated -- it had 
phone number on it and

A 
It was on Jeffrey Epstein's stationery. 
Q 
And had Jeffrey Epstein been in a Palm 
Beach resident close to those dates? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Now is there evidence of telephone calls 
between 
and 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And how many phone calls have you been 
able to identify? 
A 
At this time, there have been 14 phone 
calls.

All right. 
And just to compare that to 
the number of phone calls with

With

calls between

Q 
And that is sort of consistent with the 
number of massages that 
did versus the 
number of massages that 
did? 
A 
It is consistent with especially the 
activity that 
was providing Mr. Epstein 
compared to the activity that 
would 
provide.
