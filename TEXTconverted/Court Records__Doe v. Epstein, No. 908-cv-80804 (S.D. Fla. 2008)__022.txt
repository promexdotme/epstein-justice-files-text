UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
 
CASE NO.:  08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
 
JANE DOE, a/k/a, 
JANE DOE NO. 1, 
 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
vs. 
 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY 
ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, 
 
 
Defendants. 
________________________________/ 
 
PLAINTIFF’S REPLY TO OPPOSITION TO REMAND 
 
 
Plaintiff Jane Doe, a Florida citizen, properly sued Haley Robson, also a Florida 
citizen, in this action.  Contrary to Defendants’ contention, Defendant Robson was not 
fraudulently joined because, when viewing the factual allegations in the light most 
favorable to Plaintiff and resolving issues of Florida substantive law in favor of Plaintiff, 
it is clear that Plaintiff has cognizable causes of action against Defendant Robson for civil 
conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil RICO.  Accordingly, the 
Court should remand this action to Florida state court. 
 
A. Plaintiff is a Florida citizen 
Plaintiff alleged in her complaint and testified in deposition that she is a Florida 
resident.  (Amended Complaint ¶ 1, DE 1, pp. 301; Deposition of Jane Doe, DE 1, pp. 
31-32, 5:14-18, 6:6-10).  In their notice of removal, Defendants cite a newspaper article 
(from the same newspaper that Defendants chide Plaintiff for citing with regard to 
Defendant Robson describing herself as the Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss) in which it 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/15/2008   Page 1 of 8

is reported that Plaintiff had moved to another state in order to intimate that Plaintiff 
made fraudulent allegations regarding her residency.  (DE 1, p. 7 n.6).  Defendants then 
chide Plaintiff in their opposition to her motion for remand for not taking the bait and 
responding to this baseless allegation.  (DE 21, p. 1).  The only evidence in this case, as 
well as Plaintiff’s allegations, demonstrate that Plaintiff is a Florida citizen.  As 
Defendants have failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate otherwise, there is 
no need for Plaintiff to present additional evidence establishing her status as a Florida 
citizen.         
B.  Plaintiff has alleged cognizable causes of action against Defendant Robson 
The allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint demonstrate that Plaintiff was the victim 
in a despicable scheme orchestrated by Defendant Epstein to find and obtain underage 
girls, lure them to his home, and subject them to sexual abuse or otherwise induce them 
to engage in lewd behavior.  As much as Defendants attempt to downplay the role of 
Defendant Robson by describing her as nothing but a college student with no assets, 
Plaintiff’s complaint demonstrates that Robson was a key player in Epstein’s scheme.  
Defendant Robson was the person that actually trolled for underage girls and induced 
them with promises of money in exchange for massages in order to deliver the girls to 
Epstein’s home and get them into his bedroom.  (Amended Complaint ¶¶ 11-15, DE 1, 
pp. 302-04).  Without Defendant Robson’s role in this scheme, the underage girls, 
including Plaintiff, would not have been subjected to Defendant Epstein’s depravity and 
abuse.

1. Civil Conspiracy 
Defendants repeatedly assert that Plaintiff cannot have a cause of action for civil 
conspiracy grounded on the tort of sexual assault because Chapter 800 of the Florida 
Statutes does not create a private cause of action.  As authority for this legal proposition, 
Defendants cite Florida case law that states “not every statutory violation carries a civil 
remedy.”  (DE 21, p. 6) (citing Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Plaza Materials Corp., 908 
So. 2d 360, 374 (Fla. 2005)).  Defendants do not cite case law that states, however, that 
Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes does not create a private cause of action, nor can they 
because this appears to be a matter of first impression in Florida.   
In order to determine whether a private cause of action may be based upon a 
statutory breach, Florida courts look to the intent of the legislature.  Baumstein v. Sunrise 
Community, Inc., 738 So. 2d 420, 421 (Fla. 3d DCA 1999).  Because Florida courts have 
not examined whether the legislature intended for violations of Chapter 800 to provide 
for private causes of action, the Court should view this uncertainty regarding Florida state 
law in favor of Plaintiff.  See Crowe v. Coleman, 113 F.3d 1536, 1538 (11th Cir. 1989) 
(citation omitted). 
Furthermore, the failure of a statute to provide a private cause of action does not 
“preclude the right to bring a common law . . . claim based upon the same allegations.”  
Villazon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 843 So. 2d 842, 852 (Fla. 2003).  In her 
action for sexual assault, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Epstein tortiously assaulted her 
sexually.  (DE 1, p. 104).  Under Florida law, sexual assault is an intentional tort. See 
Doe v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., 394 F.3d 891, 917 (11th Cir. 2004) (“Florida law equates 
sexual battery with an intentional tort.”).  Thus, even if Plaintiff’s civil conspiracy claim 
 
3
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/15/2008   Page 3 of 8

cannot properly be grounded upon a violation of Chapter 800, it is properly grounded 
upon common law tortious assault.  Plaintiff’s cause of action for civil conspiracy is, 
therefore, cognizable against Defendant Robson under Florida law.                 
2. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 
Defendants next assert that Plaintiff has failed to assert a cognizable cause of 
action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against Defendant Robson because 
her allegations are not so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go 
beyond all possible bounds of decency.  (DE 21, p. 7).  They attempt to characterize 
Plaintiff as the wrongdoer because she agreed to give a massage in exchange for 
monetary compensation when she was “unlicensed, untrained, and unqualified to perform 
this professional service.”  (DE 21, p. 8).  
Defendants seem to forget that Plaintiff was just a 14-year old girl when she was 
approached by Defendant Robson and induced to agree to provide a massage to a wealthy 
man in exchange for money.  What Plaintiff certainly did not agree to do was to be 
subjected to Defendant Epstein’s perverse scheme to satisfy his depraved sexual desires.  
When read fairly, Plaintiff’s complaint tells the tale of a girl, barely a teenager, who was 
lied to and manipulated by the college-aged Defendant Robson who, for compensation, 
tempted Plaintiff with the promise of money in exchange for easy and harmless work and 
then knowingly delivered Plaintiff into the depraved hands of Defendant Epstein.  
Defendant Epstein then subjected this young girl to the despicable lewd and lascivious 
acts detailed in Plaintiff’s complaint.  It is hard to imagine any conduct that is more 
“outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of 
 
4
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/15/2008   Page 4 of 8

decency.”  Plaintiff’s cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress must, 
therefore, be recognized as cognizable under Florida law.    
3. Civil RICO 
Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to assert a cognizable cause 
of action for civil RICO against Defendant Robson because Plaintiff was injured only by 
the sexual assault, which is not a predicate act under Florida’s RICO statute.  In her 
complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants engaged in a pattern of criminal activity in 
which Defendant Robson found and delivered underage girls to Defendant Epstein in 
order for Epstein to “solicit, induce, coerce, entice, compel or force such girls to engage 
in acts of prostitution and/or lewdness.” (Amended Complaint ¶ 32, DE 1, p. 307).  She 
also alleges that she was a victim of Defendants’ scheme because she was one of the 
underage girls found and delivered to Defendant Epstein by Defendant Robson and that 
she endured Epstein’s actions as he tried to get her to engage in, and forced upon her, acts 
of prostitution and lewdness. (Amended Complaint ¶ 33, DE 1, pp. 307-308). It is for 
harm suffered as a result of these predicate acts that Plaintiff seeks damages for in Count 
IV of her complaint.  Cf. Palmas Y Bambu, S.A. v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., Inc., 
881 So. 2d 565, 570 (Fla. 3d DCA 2004) (holding plaintiff has standing to sue for civil 
RICO when her injuries flow directly from commission of the predicate acts, which 
means “when the alleged predicate act is mail or wire fraud, the plaintiff must have been 
a target of the scheme to defraud and must have relied to his detriment on 
misrepresentations made in furtherance of that scheme”). Because Plaintiff was a target 
of Defendants’ scheme and was harmed by their actions in carrying out the scheme, 
Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for civil RICO against Defendant Robson.

C. Conclusion 
Plaintiff, a Florida citizen, has alleged cognizable causes of action against Defendant 
Robson, also a Florida citizen, for civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional 
distress, and civil RICO. When viewing Plaintiff’s factual allegations in the light most 
favorable to her and resolving issues of Florida substantive law in her favor, it is clear 
that Plaintiff has not fraudulently joined Defendant Robson in this action.  Accordingly, 
the Court should remand this action to Florida state court for lack of jurisdiction.
