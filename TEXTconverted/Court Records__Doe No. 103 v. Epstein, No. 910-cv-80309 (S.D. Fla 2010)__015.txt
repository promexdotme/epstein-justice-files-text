UN1TED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO. 10-80309-CIV-
JANE DOE No. 103, 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFERY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
___________ ___;/ 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO AMEND DEFENDANT'S 
MOTION TO DISMISS. & FOR MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT & 
STRIKE DIRECTED TO PLAINTIFF JANE DOE NO. 103'S 
COMPLAINT (dated 4/5/2010) 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned 
counsel, moves to amend by his previously filed Motion To Dismiss, & Motion For More 
Definite Statement & Strike Directed To Plaintiff JANE DOE I 03 's Complaint, 
(hereinafter "Motion To Dismiss"), dated and filed April 5, 2010. 
In support of his 
motion, Defendant states: 
1. 
On April 5, 2010, Defendant previously filed with this Court his Motion To 
Dismiss. Defendant seeks dismissal of Count VI, which is brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§2255, because Plaintiff is relying on a criminal predicate act enumerated in §2255 that 
did not come into effect until after the alleged time period of the alleged conduct by 
Defendant involving Plaintiff. I 8 U.S.C. §2252A(g), the criminal statute relied upon by 
Plaintiff in attempting to assert her §2255 claim in Count VI, was not enacted until 2006; 
the allegedly violative conduct by Defendant occurred, according to Plaintiffs own 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 2 of 4
allegations, beginning in January 2004 until approximately May 2005. As argued in 
Defendant's motion to dismiss, Count VI is required to be dismissed because it violates 
the constitutional principles against retroactivity. See pages 3-11 of Defendant's motion 
to dismiss. 
2. 
Defendant is not seeking to raise a new argument, but is seeking to clarify the 
argument made in his motion to dismiss (pp. 3-11 ). Under the heading - "Motion To 
Dismiss" - at page 3-4, in the first paragraph, Defendant states in part that - "However, 
subsection (g) of §2252 was not added to the statute until 2006. Thus, to the extent that 
Plaintiff is relying on the amended version of §2255, such reliance is improper and Count 
VI is required to be dismissed as it relies on a statutory predicate act that did not exist at 
the time of the alleged conduct." 
3. 
Defendant seeks to add the following sentences (paragraph) after the first 
paragraph, at page 4, to clarify the argument being made. 
According to Plaintiffs allegations, the alleged conduct of EPSTEIN 
directed to Plaintiff occurred beginning in January 2004 until 
approximately May 2005. In Count VI, in attempting to assert a claim 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255, Plaintiff is relying on subsection, (g)(l) and 
(2), of the criminal statute 18 U.S.C. §2252A as the requisite predicate act. 
Subsection (g) of §2252A was not even in existence at the time of the 
alleged conduct. Subsection (g) was enacted in 2006, effective July 27, 
2006. See 2006 Amendments; Pub.L. 109-248, § 701, added subsec. (g). 
18 U.S.C.A. § 2252A. As discussed more fully below herein, reliance on 
subsection (g) violates the well entrenched constitutional principles 
against retroactivity, and, thus, Count VI is required to be dismissed.

4. 
Defendant also adds a sentence in the introductory paragraph of the Amended 
Motion To Dismiss, attached hereto as Exhibit A, simply stating that it is an amended 
motion. 
5. 
Such amendment is in the interest of justice and will allow both the Court and the 
Plaintiff to understand and address the argument made by Defendant in his motion to 
dismiss. 
6. 
Defendant further requests that the Amended Motion To Dismiss, Exhibit A 
hereto, be deemed filed as of the date of this motion. 
7. 
Pursuant to Rule 15(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., Defendant sought the consent of the 
opposing party as to the above amendment/supplement to his motion to dismiss. 
Plaintiffs counsel did not oppose the amendment/supplement. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court enter an Order 
granting Defendant's motion and deeming as filed as of the date of this motion 
Defendant's Amended Motion To Dismiss, & Motion For More Definite Statement & 
Strike Directed To Plaintiff JANE DOE 103 's Complaint, attached hereto as Exhibit A.
