THE COURT:  Good morning.  
1
MALE SPEAKER:  Good morning.
2
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Good morning, Your Honor.
3
THE COURT:  Ordinarily we’d start by calling the
4
case but we have a number of cases here and rather than do
5
this in a tedious way, we’ve asked everyone to sign in on an
6
appearance sheet.  And I just want to make sure I know who
7
everyone is.  So first, on plaintiff’s side in these various
8
cases, these are cases, just for the record, these are cases
9
that are brought by various plaintiffs against for shorthand
10
the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein.  
11
Can I know who Brad Edwards and Brittany Henderson
12
are?
13
MR. EDWARDS:  Yes, Your Honor.  Brad Edwards.
14
MS. HENDERSON:  Brittany Henderson.
15
THE COURT:  Okay.  Arick Fudali?
16
MR. FUDALI:  Good morning, Your Honor.  Arick
17
Fudali.
18
THE COURT:  Good morning.  Roberta Kaplan?
19
MS. KAPLAN:  Good morning, Your Honor.
20
THE COURT:  And Kate Donneger [Ph.]?
21
MS. DONNEGER:  Good morning, Your Honor.
22
THE COURT:  Good morning.  David Brody, Laura Star,
23
Alan Goldfarb and Andrew Posen [Ph.].
24
MR. BRODY:  Good morning, Your Honor.  David Brody.

MS. STAR:  Laura Star.
1
MR. POSEN:  Andrew Posen [Ph.].
2
MR. GOLDFARB:  Alan Goldfarb.
3
THE COURT:  Got it.  Then I have David Boies, Sigrid
4
McCawley, Josh Schiller.
5
MR. BOIES:  Good morning, Your Honor.  David Boies.
6
MR. SCHILLER:  Josh Schiller.  Good morning.
7
MS. McCAWLEY:  Sigrid McCawley.   
8
THE COURT:  Got it.  Marion Wang and David Mullkoff.
9
MS. WANG:  Mariann Wang.  Daniel Mullkoff will join
10
me later.  
11
THE COURT:  Okay.
12
MS. WANG:  Good morning.
13
THE COURT:  Good morning.  And on defendant’s side,
14
well, you have a fewer number of people so why don’t you just
15
introduce yourselves?
16
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Good morning, Your Honor.  Bennet
17
Moskowitz; Troutman Sanders, here with my colleague Charles
18
Glover, and we represent the co-executors of the Estate of
19
Jeffrey E. Epstein as well as with certain exceptions various
20
other defendants in the actions for which we’re here today. 
21
To explain that a little further --
22
THE COURT:  That’s all right. 
23
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That’s fine. 
24
THE COURT:  For the time being, that’s fine.
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 4 of 52

5
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you.
1
THE COURT:  All right.  So the first thing I want to
2
do is just explain what my role is in these cases and perhaps
3
what my role isn’t in these cases.  First of all, I don’t know
4
how much you all know about the inner workings of the court
5
but when a civil case comes into this court it is assigned to
6
a district judge and it is designated to a magistrate judge. 
7
Or a magistrate judge is designated on the case.  Having a
8
magistrate judge such as myself designated on a case does not
9
mean that I do anything on the case.  It usually doesn’t even
10
mean I know that the case is in front of me at all.  And
11
certainly, it doesn’t give me authority to act.  The authority
12
to act comes from an order of reference by the district judge
13
on that case.  There is a difference between a designation and
14
a reference.  When a district judge refers a case to a
15
magistrate judge, the docket for that case will have an entry
16
that says order of reference.  The order of reference will
17
specify what it’s for.  In these cases, a number of the
18
district judges have referred the cases to me for what’s
19
called general pretrial supervision.  General pretrial
20
supervision includes supervising the discovery process,
21
certain motions that are not dispositive motions, seeing if I
22
can assist with settlement, scheduling matters.  It does not
23
include dispositive motions, making reports and
24
recommendations on dispositive motions unless the order of
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 5 of 52

6
reference says that.  And an order of reference can be
1
anything as narrow as can you work on one very particular
2
thing or can you assist with settlement?  To as broad as on
3
the parties’ consent it’s before you for all purposes.  
4
The decision was made, as I understand it, that as
5
an institutional matter all these cases were not going to be
6
placed before a single district judge.  But it was also
7
decided that they would be designated to a single magistrate
8
judge so that if the district judges wanted to refer for, for
9
example, discovery supervision or to aid in settlement, that
10
would be before a single magistrate judge, and I am that lucky
11
magistrate judge.  But not all of the cases that we’ve seen
12
come into the court have been referred to me at this time.  So
13
you have to look at the dockets in your cases, and new ones as
14
they come in because I’m sure some new ones will come in, and
15
see if there is actually an order of reference.  Now, you may
16
see a different magistrate judge designated and it may have
17
slipped through the cracks.  A lot of these are just -- they
18
come out of the wheel and it’s random.  There’s one I know
19
that’s still showing a designation to Judge Fox.  I think it
20
will be re-designated to me.  If you’re noticing that and
21
you’re not noticing a re-designation to me, you can just give
22
our chambers a call and bring it to our attention and we can
23
look into that.
24
But even if they are all designated to me, which I
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 6 of 52

7
think is the plan, again, they may or may not all be referred
1
to me.  Right now there are orders of reference in, for
2
general pretrial supervision, in one, two, three, four, five,
3
six, seven, eight, and I believe there will be nine because
4
Judge Gardephe just signed one, nine of the cases out of 14. 
5
Judge Buchwald has one case that is 19-CV-10474.  I do not
6
believe she is going to refer.  I think she prefers to
7
supervise the case herself.  And there are a couple where I
8
just don’t know yet.  And of course I think there’s one that
9
may not even be assigned to a district judge yet.  And again,
10
they’re still coming in.  So just be aware of that because
11
there’s a good chance that I’m going to be supervising your
12
case for discovery and for non-dispositive disputes for
13
scheduling, for seeing if I can assist with settlement.  But
14
there is also a chance that I will not be.  All right?  And in
15
particular right now I know that Judge Buchwald does not wish
16
me to supervise hers.
17
In addition, Judge Schofield has two cases right
18
now.  They are 19-CV-10475 and 19-CV-10577.  I believe she
19
scheduled her own conference a little farther down the road. 
20
I think she still wants to go forward with that but I
21
anticipate that at some point either before then or after then
22
she is likely to refer to me as well, but she wants to get a
23
handle on it herself.  
24
So district judges are individuals.  They handle
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 7 of 52

8
things in individual ways sometimes.  And just be aware
1
dispositive motions will go in front of them unless they are
2
specifically referred to me.  And if any order of reference is
3
narrow, you have to look at it, see what it says, and
4
understand that’s the particular reason it’s before me.  All
5
right?  
6
So with that said, I nonetheless wanted to give
7
notice to anyone who’s on these cases that I was having this
8
conference so that you could be informed, so that you could be
9
present if you have an interest, and you could hear what’s
10
said.  So that’s number one.
11
Number two, I have seen in the press and in some of
12
the correspondence that was put in front of the Court in one
13
of the cases that there’s some talk about the estate working
14
toward coming up with a settlement idea, concept, a plan for
15
trying to create a fund or do something.  I’ve also seen some
16
murmurings, I don’t know if they’re true or not, that not all
17
of the plaintiffs’ attorneys might be fully on board with the
18
process that’s being set up which may not have been involving
19
them.  
20
So I’d like to understand what is going on on that
21
front.  And if it is possible to have these cases put on a
22
settlement track, I’d like to make sure that everyone’s on
23
board with the process of developing a plan for that and to
24
get a feel for what it’s going to entail, potential time line
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 8 of 52

9
issues that are involved so that we can first see before we
1
get into discovery issues other kinds of squabbles, see if in
2
fact settlement is possible and we can move toward that.
3
So let me start on defendant’s side since rumor has
4
it, and see what you have to say on that.
5
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Good morning, Your Honor.  Would you
6
like me to stand or --
7
THE COURT:  It’s okay.
8
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I’m happy to.  I’m glad you raised
9
this because one of the things I wanted to bring to Your
10
Honor’s attention is that having assumed, although I don’t
11
like assumptions, that you may have seen in the press that
12
there is some kind of a claims program, I wanted to actually
13
take the opportunity today to explain to you briefly what is
14
going on.  And since you asked specifically, I’ll start there. 
15
16
So there is what I feel confident in calling an
17
extraordinary opportunity that has already started that can
18
lead to an alternative to all this litigation.  A lot of
19
people here as you can see.  And this would be an
20
extraordinary opportunity also to conserve party and judicial
21
resources.  And what happened is almost a week ago exactly the
22
co-executors, and this is probably some of the stories you
23
have seen, filed through counsel, not us, through estate
24
counsel in US Virgin Islands where the will is being probated,
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 9 of 52

10
an application for expedited approval of a claims
1
administration process.  So if I can just briefly explain what
2
that action means and what was actually filed because with
3
respect to everyone in the room, I don’t know that every story
4
was as accurate as each other.  So the filing was for approval
5
to have the process go forward.  I fully expect it will be
6
approved.  I’m not the Court, obviously.  But I have every
7
reason to believe it will be promptly approved.  What it is
8
not is actually the nuts and bolts of how the program will
9
work.  What it does is it says the executors have selected
10
very esteemed people, Kenneth Feinberg who many view, I
11
believe rightfully so, is the nation’s leading claims
12
administration expert.  Jordana Feldman, who is also a leading
13
expert.  She actually just very recently left her position as
14
deputy special master of the September 11th victim compensation
15
fund.  And she has demonstrated through that profound empathy
16
for victims, deep commitment to fairness of process, fairness
17
of outcome.  And also Camille Viras [Ph.] who has worked with
18
Mr. Feinberg over many years and is also a leading expert.  I
19
selected those three people to design, and then Ms. Feldman to
20
administer the program.  However, what’s happening now is now
21
that the filing has been made, and this is all in the filing
22
and for any details I don’t have I would encourage anyone who
23
has questions on the plaintiff’s side to reach out to the
24
program administrators and designers for whom I don’t speak
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 10 of 52

11
because they’re fully independent.  But what the application
1
laid out is basically the overview of what the program is and
2
is not leaving open what will be the protocol for the design
3
of how the program works on a finer basis to be designed now
4
with input invited from every plaintiff’s attorney sitting
5
here today, their clients, and anyone else who’s out there
6
that is contemplating bringing a claim against the estate
7
related to, you know, these general sexual abuse allegations. 
8
So everyone is invited to provide input.  
9
Ms. Feldman will have complete autonomy.  She has
10
completed autonomy as to decision-making authority over the
11
program operations and to claim determinations.  The estate
12
has no authority, will have no authority to modify or reject
13
Ms. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim.  The
14
claimants will retain their rights unless and until they
15
actually accept a determination.  So in other words, this
16
again, all through the filing and what’s been reported in the
17
press, everyone in this room, their clients can, it’s
18
voluntary, but again, extraordinary opportunity, they can
19
through the entire process of the claims program, find out if
20
they’re eligible to receive a claim determination, receive a
21
claim determination, and then decide do they want to accept it
22
or not.  Unless they accept it and sign a release, all their
23
legal rights in terms of these lawsuits are preserved.  So I
24
will say right now, and it’s probably not necessarily a
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 11 of 52

12
discussion for today, but it’s directly relevant to what
1
you’ve asked me about, we of course on the co-executors side
2
are more than willing to work with plaintiffs to stay actions,
3
toll claims, whatever they need to preserve their claims so
4
they have no prejudice if they also then go forward to see if
5
the claims process can resolve their claim in a much more, you
6
know, general I shall say, more efficient than most civil
7
litigation works in this country, and confidentially which I
8
should point out means that it’s a confidential process and
9
the estate itself is bound by certain confidentiality.  But
10
the claimants are more than free absent, you know, certain
11
things and we worked on the protocol, to go out and tell their
12
stories if they still want to.  So that’s what I mean when I
13
say confidential.  I know there have been a lot of concerns
14
about people wanting to proceed anonymously so that the claims
15
process is great for that concern too.
16
There is no cap as I understand it on the claims
17
determinations meaning whatever the claims administrators
18
decide in their expert judgment should be awarded to someone
19
there’s not going to be an arbitrating limit in any way on
20
what that is.  Again, encourage anyone with specific questions
21
in that regard to weigh in on the protocol and to ask the
22
administrators themselves.  And I would just like to say that,
23
you know, because of this extraordinary opportunity, I think
24
it would be a bad outcome for the Court, a bad outcome for all
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 12 of 52

13
the parties in here on both sides for these cases to move full
1
steam ahead while this opportunity is now live.  I mean the
2
approval says the timing will be prompt.  The claims
3
administrators expect that within 90 days or so of the Court’s
4
approval of the filing they’ll start receiving claims.  This
5
is not going to be a long drawn out thing.  And I see no
6
benefit to in the meantime having people, you know, clutter
7
these dockets with things that could probably, we hope, and I
8
expect and hope, will ultimately be avoided forever.
9
THE COURT:  All right.  One thing I forgot to say up
10
front is you don’t see a court reporter sitting here.  We do
11
have electronic recording equipment which means that if all
12
goes well there should be a recording of this conference.  And
13
so if anyone wants to have a transcript made, that’s possible. 
14
And this is an on-the-record conference.  If you’re not
15
familiar with how to go about obtaining a transcript, I think
16
most people are, but if you’re not, you can order it through
17
the court’s website.  The website was just redesigned so the
18
instructions I used to give people about this are now a little
19
different.  But I believe that up at the top of the website
20
you’ll see a few horizontal lines that suggest maybe there’s a
21
drop down menu there.  And if you click on it, you should find
22
something about courtroom technology.  And if you follow
23
through and scroll down on that page you should find something
24
about what’s called electronic court reportings or ECR which
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 13 of 52

14
will tell you how to go about ordering a transcript.  
1
Because we do not have a court reporter and because
2
any record will be through somebody typing up what they are
3
hearing on a recording, I’m going to ask anyone who speaks to
4
introduce yourself each time before you speak so that there’s
5
no confusion as to who’s speaking.  That was Mr. Moskowitz
6
speaking, correct?
7
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Correct, Your Honor.  Thank you.
8
THE COURT:  Correct.  Okay.  So if anyone else wants
9
to speak on this subject, just please identify who you are
10
again because there are a lot of you on plaintiff’s side. 
11
Anyone on plaintiff’s side want to say something on the
12
subject?
13
MS. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, Roberta Kaplan.  I’m
14
counsel for the pseudonymous plaintiff in the case pending
15
before Judge Failla.  
16
You heard I think a number of times Mr. Moskowitz
17
use the word extraordinary.  And on that word and perhaps that
18
word only I’m in full agreement with Mr. Moskowitz.  I have
19
been -- I and many of my counsel here have been litigating in
20
this courthouse for combined decades and we are approached the
21
other side as a group many weeks ago to try to talk about,
22
negotiate, and be involved in a settlement process that would
23
be set up to administer claims for 14, 15, 16-year-old
24
children who were criminally abused, sexually abused by Mr.
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 14 of 52

15
Epstein.  There was radio silence, complete radio silence on
1
their end for week after week despite repeated entreaties from
2
myself and others for us to have involvement in who was
3
selected and who would be in charge of this.  These are women
4
who want agency over their lives, number one?  Two, what the
5
procedure would be.  And three, Your Honor, perhaps most
6
importantly, how much money would be set aside?  We have
7
basically no information about what’s in the estate, what
8
assets are in the estate, what assets are not in the estate,
9
who is the beneficiary of the estate.  We are told it’s Mr.
10
Epstein’s brother but we have no due diligence on that.  And
11
we said to the other side that before this process was created
12
we thought we were entitled to some due diligence about what
13
assets are being put on the table to settle claims and what
14
assets are going to go to Mr. Epstein’s brother.  We’ve had
15
zero disclosure about that.  We’ve had zero discussions about
16
who the person would be and how to set it up.  I’m always,
17
Your Honor, and I think I speak for everyone here, we are
18
always willing to keep an open mind about settlement.  But
19
given the way that this has been created, the secret
20
unilateral way that this has been created that frankly was
21
incredibly disrespectful to these women who have already
22
suffered criminal horrible abuse, we have serious doubts.  And
23
the idea that we would stay any of these matters in favor of
24
the process that he described I think would be irrational for
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 15 of 52

16
many of us.  I don’t know if Your Honor has any questions but
1
at least in my case I think that’s our reaction.
2
THE COURT:  I’ll hear from anyone else who wants to
3
be heard on this topic. 
4
MR. EDWARDS:  Sure.  Your Honor, Brad Edwards.  I’m
5
here on behalf of VE, Catlin [Ph.] Doe, Priscilla Doe, and
6
Lisa Doe for plaintiffs proceeding under pseudonyms.
7
I agree with most of what Ms. Kaplan said.  I will
8
say that it seems to me that this slow developing vague
9
settlement concept, once it gets set up it might be okay or it
10
might be good for some people.  It doesn’t make any sense at
11
all that is an all or nothing thing meaning we have said we’re
12
willing to talk settlement as per our Rule 26 obligations with
13
any of the individual plaintiffs.  And what I understand is
14
we’re not going to do that.  It is either you’re going to be a
15
part of this process like it or not, and you may like it, you
16
may not, you don’t know much about it, we can’t tell you much
17
about it, but we hope that you’ll just stay your actions while
18
we try to develop what it is or is not.  That doesn’t seem
19
like it’s a very responsible way to approach this.  There
20
could also be some discussion on individual claims along the
21
way especially lawsuits that have already proceeded.  I’m just
22
going to just give you an example.  I filed the case on behalf
23
of VE more than 60 days ago.  We’ve already had our Rule 26
24
conference.  I have an initial pretrial conference still set
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 16 of 52

17
for December 6.  I would say that trial could be had by July. 
1
These are very simple cases.  Why in the world would we be
2
made to stay this case basically for at least 90 more days for
3
this thing to get set up and time to then go through the
4
process.  We could have had a trial by the time that we even
5
learn what this process is, so that I could educate my clients
6
on whether or not this might or might not be a good deal.  So
7
I think it only makes sense --
8
THE COURT:  Which case are you talking about again?
9
MR. EDWARDS:  VE.  It is --
10
THE COURT:  Before Judge Nathan?
11
MR. EDWARDS:  Yes.
12
THE COURT:  So she has a conference on which day?
13
MR. EDWARDS:  December 6.  And we held our Rule 26
14
conference November 15th.
15
THE COURT:  And do you think this case can go to
16
trial that fast?
17
MR. EDWARDS:  Yes, Your Honor.  I’m very familiar
18
with these cases in that I litigated when Mr. Epstein was
19
alive these same types of cases for over ten years.  So I’m
20
intimately familiar with the facts.  They are very simple
21
cases to try.  I think that by next summer they could be ready
22
for trial.  But certainly, we are ready to propound discovery. 
23
We have less than five depositions to take in the case and
24
we’re ready to go.  I don’t want that to be delayed because
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 17 of 52

18
we’re trying to set up what is, as you can tell, very slow
1
developing vague concept that might be acceptable or might
2
not.  So I just don’t want for the plaintiffs who are already
3
pursuing these actions to be prejudiced waiting for something
4
that’s being unilaterally created.  And we don’t have great
5
confidence that many plaintiffs are going to opt in but we
6
have an open mind and are willing once it’s set up to engage. 
7
That’s just not the time right now.  So that’s our position as
8
it stands.
9
THE COURT:  Anyone else?
10
MS. McCAWLEY:  This is Sigrid McCawley and myself
11
along with David Boies and Josh Schiller, we represent five of
12
the victims who filed suit to date.
13
I echo Ms. Kaplan’s concerns.  We have been part of
14
this dialogue with the reach out to help craft something that
15
would be responsible and reasonable for the victims who are at
16
issue here and the fact that the defendants unilaterally
17
selected a group without that input I think is inappropriate. 
18
We are learning more about it today obviously so we’ll reserve
19
final judgment on that.  We are of course open, and our
20
clients are open, to discussing the possibility of settlement
21
but I do have significant concerns about what they filed in
22
the USVI.
23
THE COURT:  Anyone else?  All right.  For cases to
24
settle, I’m going to direct this to defendants, for cases to
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 18 of 52

19
settle there has to be not just interest on both sides but
1
there has to be seats at the table on both sides.  There has
2
to be willingness to participate from both sides.  Settlement
3
is uniquely non-unilateral.  And if the defendants are really
4
interested in trying to get these cases resolved outside of
5
the litigation context, then you have to do more than just say
6
they’re invited to the table and some window of time.  There
7
has to be a real concerted effort to get people talking to
8
each other and to get plaintiffs’ counsel on board with what
9
you’re trying to do.  And they may or may not be so readily on
10
board.  And you have to, on defendant’s side, be willing to
11
have an open mind, you know, and have people who are willing
12
to talk and maybe bend and maybe rethink if plaintiffs have a
13
different idea and the different idea’s a good one.  So this
14
being presented to them as well this is what it’s going to be
15
and you can have some input after we’ve already figured out
16
some basics may not be sitting real well.
17
MR. FUDALI:  May I address that, Your Honor?
18
THE COURT:  Sure.
19
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I don’t think that that’s how we
20
view this.  Defendants’ counsel are correct.  Many of them
21
reached out to us and said they would welcome a claims
22
administration program.  It is true that the co-executors
23
vetted and carefully selected Ken Feinberg, Jordana Feldman,
24
and Camille Viras, like I said, unquestionably the leading
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 19 of 52

20
people in the field, to be independent claims administrators. 
1
So this is not a situation where we’ve set up a --
2
THE COURT:  Right.  But they were -- but these
3
independent claims administrators were selected by one side
4
and not agreed upon by both.
5
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Absolutely.  And I think Mr.
6
Feinberg’s 98 percent or so participation rate in the 9/11
7
fund speaks for itself as well as his experience with the
8
church sexual abuse system, claims process in the BP oil
9
spill.  All of these situations, I don’t believe that
10
claimants went out and hired Mr. Feinberg yet they were very
11
successful programs.  And here nothing’s been fully baked. 
12
All that was in the public filing, the very public filing that
13
I guess I heard some people aren’t aware of the details and I
14
absolutely encourage them to read it, is that the program is
15
now going to be set up.  The protocol is everything for how
16
the program works is my understanding.
17
THE COURT:  Well, are the names of --
18
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  And that is when the sides should
19
come together and the administrators I fully expect and
20
understand will be in communication if they aren’t already.  I
21
don’t know.
22
THE COURT:  Let me interrupt you for a second.
23
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.
24
THE COURT:  Are the names of the administrators, the
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 20 of 52

21
choice of the administrators, is that fully baked?  Or is
1
there a possibility to add someone to that group for example?
2
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I don’t know about the latter, but
3
yes, they have been selected as the administrators.  I mean
4
another thing I point out is that -- another thing that’s
5
unusual in this situation is that the estate is subject to the
6
probate court.  So what was presented to them was a very good
7
faith above and beyond effort to.  I can assure you, though I
8
don’t speak for the estate counsel and I don’t speak for the
9
administrators that the co-executors are hiring Ken Feinberg,
10
Jordana Feldman, Camille Viras, have a very sincere desire to
11
have a successful program that can resolve in a much more
12
efficient resolution of claims in a non-adversarial fashion. 
13
I mean a lot of careful vetting and due diligence went in on
14
their end and I do understand that some of the plaintiffs’
15
lawyers maybe had different picks of who they wanted to be. 
16
Some of them I should say as well were rather inflexible in
17
that regard.  And it is correct we didn’t choose necessarily
18
who their top people are.  But this notion that we’ve gone out
19
and we’re imposing this vague thing on them I don’t think it’s
20
fair.  And again, they’re right, it’s voluntary.  I would hope
21
that they appreciate, like I said, that this is a significant
22
opportunity to resolve claims that will not result in any
23
detriment.  
24
I also want to just quickly touch upon Mr. Edwards
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 21 of 52

22
raised the timing.  He did litigate cases not in this court. 
1
I think that’s a very aggressive view of timing on his end. 
2
We haven’t even answered the complaint and the action which we
3
have this quote/unquote Rule 26 conference during which we
4
really didn’t have much to talk about because we haven’t even
5
answered the complaint.  I view that as maybe that perhaps
6
fell through on the court’s side, not Your Honor, on whether
7
that should occur then.  So we had it out of caution.  But
8
this notion that we’re months away from significant things
9
happening in these cases, I don’t know what the basis for that
10
is.
11
THE COURT:  So some of the questions that have been
12
raised over here about the size of the fund, what assets are
13
in the estate, what assets are not in the estate, you said
14
that claims would not be capped.  But is the fund a certain
15
amount?
16
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I don’t have the answer to that
17
question.  Certainly that’s an issue that should be discussed
18
at this time along with any other issue that plaintiffs want
19
to raise.  They should call Ms. Feldman, call Mr. Feinberg,
20
set up times to meet with them.  Again, I don’t speak for
21
them.  But my understanding is they want to hear from all
22
interested parties.  They finally made that clear.
23
THE COURT:  Well, you’re counsel in this case.  So
24
if cases settle --
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 22 of 52

23
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.
1
THE COURT:  -- in this Court, I would think you
2
would need to be involved as well in this process and not
3
just, you know, refer them to somebody else who’s not
4
representing a party.  So I think you need to be more
5
personally involved, you or your firm or one of the firms
6
involved representing defendants, and try to ensure that there
7
is good dialogue, that there is good communication, and that
8
what plaintiffs’ counsel has to say is not falling on deaf
9
ears, is not, you know, not being responded to.
10
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Agree 100 percent and that’s fully
11
our intent.  This was just filed a week ago.  And also, we
12
will be fully involved; however, not at the expense of
13
inserting ourselves into anything that the administrators view
14
as solely within their domain as independent claims
15
administrators.  So there’s a little question there that yes,
16
we will communicate with them.  We encourage plaintiffs’
17
counsel to do the same.  We will stay fully involved to find
18
out what’s going on.
19
THE COURT:  Will you have authority to settle any
20
individual case outside of this framework that you’re
21
discussing?
22
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Settlement discussions are always
23
welcome.  I don’t have any specific authority in that regard
24
but no door is closed.
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 23 of 52

24
THE COURT:  All right.  What I’d like to do with
1
respect to settlement is have an update after there’s been a
2
period of time when everyone has been conferring and
3
plaintiffs have been at the table through their counsel to
4
give me just a status report on how that’s going and whether
5
it’s looking promising or whether it’s not from anyone’s point
6
of view.  And that doesn’t mean other things can’t be handled
7
on a parallel track.  But I think that settlement is an
8
important track.  Plaintiffs are clearly interested. 
9
Defendants are clearly interested.  And when everyone’s
10
interested in settlement, seems to me that’s the first thing
11
you want to all try to do.  But it’s got to really be a
12
process where everyone really has seats at the table, it’s not
13
just lip service to seats at the table, okay, to discuss any
14
and everything that seems important to that process including,
15
you know, how much is in a fund and including, you know, what
16
is in this estate and not, so that plaintiffs understand, it’s
17
almost like early disclosure of an insurance policy in a case. 
18
Well, what is there?  Right.  That’s one thing that’s under
19
Rule 26(a), a part of it, is to understand on plaintiff’s side
20
what resources are there that are available towards
21
settlement.  That’s one reason why that information becomes
22
important.
23
All right.  I’m going to move on from that and we’ll
24
talk about timing at the end with respect to anything and
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 24 of 52

25
everything.  I know that in some cases defendants haven’t even
1
been served much less answered and there may also be motions. 
2
There may also be motions to dismiss.  I know there is at
3
least a potential statute of limitations issue that’s out
4
there that defendants may wish to litigate, may not wish to
5
litigate.  Don’t know.  Can you tell me on defendant’s side
6
whether there are any motions planned?
7
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, there are motions planned, Your
8
Honor, and the statute of limitations are certainly relevant
9
to some of those motions.  I don’t have all the bases for the
10
motions that we’ll begin filing I believe starting next week. 
11
And actually, I have a quick question if I can get back to
12
that on the timing.  Among other things, every plaintiff has
13
asked for punitive damages but those are expressly barred by
14
New York statute and other jurisdictions that they may argue
15
are relevant.  So we will be moving to dismiss claims for
16
punitive damages as well.  And again, we are developing other
17
bases for motions.
18
THE COURT:  Right.  As I said, as far as I know I
19
don’t have any of these cases for dispositive motions to issue
20
reports and recommendations on dispositive motions.  So any
21
such motions remain before the district judge.  I can probably
22
with respect to most -- different judges are different, but
23
with respect to most of them, I can probably set a schedule
24
for the motions, but I’m not going to be the one who decides
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 25 of 52

26
the motions.  With respect to scheduling, on any motion of any
1
kind I always appreciate if lawyers talk to one another and
2
propose briefing schedules because, you know, I’m assuming
3
you’ll be reasonable.  If it looks unreasonable to me like
4
we’ll brief this motion in three months and do an opposition
5
three months later I will say no, you’re not going to do that. 
6
But most times lawyers can propose sensible schedules and,
7
like I said, always appreciate it if you talk to one another. 
8
With respect to discovery, if there are dispositive motions,
9
that does not necessarily stay discovery.  The default in this
10
Court is it does not stay discovery.  There has to be an order
11
from the Court saying discovery is stayed.  But it may make
12
sense if there is a dispositive motion to stay discovery in
13
whole or in part, very often what I do in cases is I try to
14
get a feel for what should be done soon, it’s not overly
15
burdensome, and where there some reason to do it sooner, what
16
should be put off until later because maybe you save the money
17
on it and maybe it’s less important at that initial juncture. 
18
And I try to do something that is sensible that allows the
19
case to move in a sensible way with an understanding that
20
motions are pending.  So when you confer about discovery when
21
we get there, think about that as well.  Don’t simply argue to
22
me if there’s a motion that it should be all or nothing.  You
23
can argue that, but also talk about whether there’s some
24
compromise approach that makes sense for the particular needs
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 26 of 52

27
of the particular case.  
1
With respect to settlement, keep one eye on that
2
even if you’re engaged in discovery because I’m a firm
3
believer that there are windows where cases are capable of
4
being settled.  And sometimes it needs a certain something in
5
discovery to aid that.  Now, maybe as part of a claims
6
administration process documentation would be submitted or
7
would be discussed in that separate process anyway, but it may
8
be that you need discovery in the litigation to have in hand
9
certain discovery before you can figure out the right
10
settlement for a particular case.  So that might be a higher
11
priority item because if you want to go toward an early
12
settlement there may be certain things in discovery that are
13
particularly important to learn or understand before you are
14
in a position to accept or reject a proposed settlement or to
15
make a proposed settlement.
16
It seems a little bit premature, even though I
17
wanted to get a jump on these cases, to be setting discovery
18
schedules especially in cases where there’s not been an
19
answer, certainly in cases where there’s not even been
20
service.  And especially in cases where there may be a motion
21
in lieu of an answer.  But I do want everyone to confer about
22
discovery and I want everyone to submit proposals.  The more
23
joint they are, the better.  The more you have really
24
conferred the better.  When I talk about good faith
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 27 of 52

28
conference, I don’t mean I sent an email and I didn’t get a
1
response yet.  When I talk about good faith conference I mean
2
you picked up the phone, you spoke to each other, you talked
3
through issues, you tried to work out issues and only if you
4
can’t then you bring them to my attention.  That goes for
5
discovery along the way.  I will not even entertain a
6
discovery dispute if it doesn’t appear to me that you fully
7
conferred in good faith.
8
Pet peeve, we’re not there yet, pet peeve I get a
9
discovery motion, I get an opposition that says we’ll do
10
certain things, I get a reply that says never mind, I have
11
wasted my time reading it.  All it tells me is you’ve had a
12
failure of good faith conference.  You should have been able
13
to figure that out through talking to each other rather than
14
spending money on briefing.
15
I’ll also note, by the way, that Ms. Kaplan, you
16
sent me, I think you’re the one who sent me three binders of
17
courtesy copies of things, yes?  Those are your binders?
18
MS. KAPLAN:  I believe so.  So Your Honor, two
19
issues.  One, we have an issue about spoliation that we hope
20
to be decided today.  And two, Judge Failla called us
21
yesterday and told us that she wanted you to decide the
22
pseudonymous --
23
THE COURT:  That’s fine.
24
MS. KAPLAN:  -- motion in our case.  So that’s what
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 28 of 52

29
we sent you, Your Honor.
1
THE COURT:  That’s fine.  You don’t have to spend
2
your time and money putting together beautiful binders for me. 
3
I mean it’s very nice, but I have three binders which I’ve
4
combined into one.  I mean I have three binders combined in
5
one.  One had, I don’t know, maybe four, three documents and I
6
said oops, there’s one missing.  So instead of sending the one
7
that was missing you sent an entire new binder that had four
8
instead of three.  And then there was another one with
9
separate tabs and separate letters and separate cover pages
10
and I just took it all apart and put it all in one and I
11
really didn’t even need it at all.  But thank you.  And then
12
in the binders I did get, with respect to the Jane Doe issue,
13
the one thing that I actually wanted to see which was the two
14
competing proposed orders, one of those was missing from the
15
binder.  Defendant’s was not in there.  So come on, if you’re
16
going to give me binders and you’re going to give me courtesy
17
copies, at least give me the things that I’m most going to
18
want to see.  But save your time, save your energy, save your
19
money.  If it’s something lengthy that has a lot of exhibits
20
I’m not going to want to print out, yes, courtesy copies are
21
really appreciated.  But you can just stick a courtesy copy in
22
an envelope and say here’s a courtesy copy.  I don’t need
23
things so pretty.  It’s nice but it’s not actually necessary
24
especially if you ask for fees later and complaining that you
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 29 of 52

30
spent money on this sort of thing.
1
MS. KAPLAN:  I apologize, Your Honor.
2
THE COURT:  That’s okay.
3
MS. KAPLAN:  I think from our perspective there was
4
some lack of understanding as to --
5
THE COURT:  Don’t apologize for trying to be
6
organized and have a nice presentation.  I appreciate it.  I’m
7
not trying to be critical.  I’m just saying it’s really not
8
necessary.  On the John Doe -- John Doe?  Jane Doe, Jane Doe
9
issues, I have no problem signing an order.  The only question
10
is what form of order.  And because there are several cases
11
with Jane Does or somebody Doe, and because many of those, if
12
not all, most, are going be referred to me for general
13
pretrial supervision which will include decisions like that,
14
it would be nice to have some uniformity.  So I know that
15
Judge Castel has already issued a couple of orders.
16
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, I have an update.  I
17
apologize to interrupt.  I do have an update about this issue.
18
THE COURT:  You’ve requested that Judge Castel do
19
something different?
20
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  No.  Mr. Edwards and I, recognizing
21
that uniformity makes sense and recognizing that it would be a
22
shame to burden the Court with motion, continued motion
23
practice about this because as we’ve clarified in our
24
responses that Your Honor may or may not have seen --
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 30 of 52

31
THE COURT:  You’re going along with the form of
1
order that Judge Castel issued?
2
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Right.  We don’t object to anonymity
3
from the general public.  We just want to make sure it doesn’t
4
come at the expense of our ability to defend the actions.  And
5
Mr. Edwards and I agreed yesterday in principle to a form
6
order that I’m going to promptly send him.  I’ll try to do it
7
today.  This was just late afternoon yesterday.  And I
8
respectfully submit that it makes sense to have that order
9
entered in each action.  It strikes the right balance between
10
protecting the plaintiffs’ anonymity from the general public
11
and also making sure we are free to defend the case by using
12
that information without otherwise exposing it to people that
13
it shouldn’t go to.
14
THE COURT:  Well, I must say I don’t envy you both
15
because you’re before a lot of different district judges who
16
are individuals and will handle cases differently.  Also, you
17
have a lot of different plaintiffs’ lawyers who are different
18
and may want to handle cases differently.  On plaintiff’s
19
side, you know, if you had been, whoever it was -- I’m not
20
sure who it was who wanted to have the cases all put before
21
one judge, whether it was defendant’s side that wanted to do
22
that or plaintiffs’ side.
23
MS. KAPLAN:  I’m the guilty party, Your Honor.
24
THE COURT:  Okay.  If you had been successful in
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 31 of 52

32
having the cases before one judge, you would have had to have
1
coordinated among plaintiffs’ counsel either to figure out
2
who’d be lead counsel or at least who would take the lead on
3
something like proposing the terms of an order like this.  So
4
I’m hoping that even though you’re spread out among different
5
judges, plaintiffs’ counsel can coordinate and can have one
6
voice for negotiating something like that and have one order,
7
one form of order that can govern in all of these cases for
8
anyone who wants to proceed under a pseudonym.  And it may be
9
because Judge Castel has already entered orders, that’s fine,
10
but I’m sure he would be fine with my modifying an order to
11
make it consistent with orders in other cases if that makes
12
more sense.  Right?  So I understand defendant’s view, I
13
understand the views that have been articulated by Ms. Kaplan
14
in her correspondence.  There ought to be a happy medium that
15
protects anonymity and it still doesn’t prejudice defendants. 
16
You may have gone a little overboard in the protections you
17
were seeking.  They can be addressed as we go to some extent. 
18
See if you can work it out.  Possible to work it out?  I’m
19
hoping.
20
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Will do, Your Honor.
21
MS. KAPLAN:  We will try, Your Honor.
22
THE COURT:  Okay.  You can do it.  I’m quite
23
confident you can manage to come up with a proposed order for
24
anonymity that will make sense and not prejudice anyone’s
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 32 of 52

33
rights.  
1
With respect to spoliation, it’s raised in one case,
2
the Judge Failla case, which is 8673.  I have a simple
3
response to this.  Counsel should know what their obligations
4
are and those obligations are pretty clear under the law and
5
counsel should take them seriously.  If you do not preserve
6
evidence that should be preserved that you had a reason to
7
believe was relevant to claims or defenses in the case and
8
that you didn’t take steps to preserve, there can be negative
9
consequences down the road.  In order to be confident about
10
what evidence it is that you better take steps to preserve, it
11
can’t hurt to be asking plaintiff’s counsel to summarize for
12
you those things that you think are important if they’re
13
potentially going to make something of this.  That’s just for
14
your information.  But ultimately it is defendant’s obligation
15
to preserve.  I don’t think I should have to tell them that. 
16
And I don’t plan at this point to issue an order with respect
17
to preservation unless and until I see something where it
18
seems fairly clear that there has been, you know, a lack of
19
preservation or there’s been that conduct.  The one thing that
20
was brought out by Ms. Kaplan with respect to the need for
21
spoliation was a story that was reported somewhere in the
22
press where defendants have said no, you misunderstood what
23
happened.  At this point I have no reason to doubt what
24
defendants’ counsel are saying about what happened, so
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 33 of 52

34
therefore, I have no reason to believe there is bad faith or
1
bad conduct.  And so therefore, I’m going to deny the request
2
to order preservation.  I’m only going to remind everyone of
3
their obligations as counsel to preserve evidence which should
4
go without saying.
5
MS. KAPLAN:  The only thing I would add to that,
6
Your Honor, we’re fine with that, is that Mr. Epstein, as Your
7
Honor surely knows, has multiple residences in multiple
8
countries across the world.  And we just want to make sure
9
that those same efforts are ongoing with respect to every --
10
the Virgin Islands, Paris, New Mexico, New York, Florida, and
11
we haven’t gotten that assurance.
12
THE COURT:  So counsel, you heard it here.  Make
13
sure your efforts are broad enough.  And this motion is an
14
example to me of the good faith conference point.  You know,
15
it seemed to me that further conference about what had
16
happened with respect to the incident, it seems you did have
17
some back and forth about this.  But I mean a preservation
18
order from the Court is fairly significant.  There has to be
19
something that really spurs it.  And I think on plaintiffs’
20
side hearing that the story in the press was -- that some bag
21
had been removed from somewhere which was really not
22
documents, I gather was some clothing --
23
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  It was clothing for the decedent to
24
be laid to rest in, Your Honor.
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 34 of 52

35
THE COURT:  Yes.  I mean if there’s a reason to
1
doubt that, there’s a reason to doubt that.  You’ll tell the
2
Court.  If there isn’t, then we don’t have something
3
extraordinary.  All right?  But we do have a decedent who had
4
a lot of property, had a lot of locations where he could be
5
found at various points in time and the preservation
6
obligation is going to be fairly broad, still tailored to
7
what’s relevant to this case but still fairly broad.  And some
8
of these allegations do go back in time which makes the time
9
frame for preservation that much more challenging.
10
All right.  Any other particular issues that anyone
11
wants to raise?  Pseudonymous, spoliation, anything else? 
12
Okay.  
13
So what I’d like you to do is confer among the
14
plaintiffs’ counsel -- by the way, do you know, do you
15
anticipate more cases being filed and if so, how many more? 
16
Can you give me a clue?  Do you know if there are more
17
plaintiffs’ counsel out there who are likely to be
18
representing parties?
19
MR. FUDALI:  Arick Fudali, Your Honor, the Bloom
20
Firm.  I can tell the Court that we do anticipate filing more
21
lawsuits in this case.  I can’t say if there’s other plaintiff
22
attorneys involved.  But from our perspective, I believe at
23
least at this point there is a plan to file more lawsuits.
24
THE COURT:  Can you give me an approximate number? 
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 35 of 52

36
I won’t hold you to it.
1
MR. FUDALI:  I can say less than five probably.
2
THE COURT:  Okay.
3
MR. FUDALI:  But please don’t hold me to that.
4
THE COURT:  I won’t.  I just wanted to get a feel.
5
MR. FUDALI:  The other issue is, Your Honor, and
6
perhaps you were about to address this, but I think to echo
7
what some of my colleagues said earlier is about clarity.  I
8
think the problem is that a lot of the plaintiffs are having,
9
plaintiffs’ attorneys, we’re all in the dark and we’re all
10
waiting and that’s not something plaintiffs or plaintiffs'
11
attorneys like to do.  So I don’t know if Your Honor is
12
willing to --
13
THE COURT:  In the dark and waiting for what?
14
MR. FUDALI:  I’m sorry, details of the settlement
15
program.
16
THE COURT:  Okay.
17
MR. FUDALI:  And I wonder if Your Honor is willing
18
to set some sort of deadline --
19
THE COURT:  Yes.  I’m going to do that.
20
MR. FUDALI:  -- that defendants could give us some
21
details, that we have something to bring back to our clients.
22
THE COURT:  Well, I’m going to set a deadline for
23
reporting back to me on the status of the settlement process
24
and by that deadline there will have had to have been
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 36 of 52

37
discussions because I do not want a status report that says we
1
know nothing, we haven’t been talking, we are in the dark.
2
MR. FUDALI:  Okay.  Yes.
3
THE COURT:  Because that would be pointless for a
4
status report.
5
MR. FUDALI:  I think just, yeah, we all just want
6
more detail so our clients can make an informed decision
7
immediately or at least in the near future so we’re not just
8
waiting, you know, with deciding.
9
THE COURT:  Okay.
10
MR. FUDALI:  Thank you, Your Honor.
11
MS. WANG:  Good morning.  Marion Wang.  I just
12
wanted to inform Your Honor that we filed another case this
13
morning, so we have a total of three cases.
14
THE COURT:  I think we saw that one.  We’ve been
15
checking. 
16
THE CLERK:  [Inaudible].
17
THE COURT:  We didn’t see that one?  We saw another
18
one?
19
THE CLERK:  [Inaudible].
20
THE COURT:  Oh, we saw one from yesterday.
21
MS. WANG:  We filed one yesterday and we filed one
22
this morning.
23
THE COURT:  Okay.
24
MS. WANG:  So we have three total.  Two are on your
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 37 of 52

38
appearance list, and so there’s a third one.
1
THE COURT:  Do you have the docket number on that
2
one, the case number on that one?
3
MS. WANG:  Yes, we do.  My colleague does.
4
THE COURT:  It’s 19-CV something.
5
MS. WANG:  Yes.  It is 10788.
6
THE COURT:  Okay.  Can anyone else give me any ideas
7
to roughly how many more may be coming down the pike?
8
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, Brad Edwards.  Potentially
9
dozens more cases could be filed.  I’m just not sure whether
10
they’re going to be filed here or potentially in the Virgin
11
Islands or Florida.  So it’s tough to --
12
THE COURT:  Through your firm?
13
MR. EDWARDS:  Through our firm.
14
THE COURT:  Okay.  I would just urge that if you’re
15
anticipating filing more cases, you try to get on with it and
16
not have this continuing sort of trickle of cases because
17
especially if we start setting schedules for things, I’m
18
trying to have some consistency on how cases are handled.  If
19
one comes in a month down the road, another one comes in two
20
months down the road, another one comes in three months down
21
the road, you’re not going to be on the same schedule. 
22
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, I’ll tell you that Mr.
23
Moskowitz and I have been conferring pretty thoroughly on
24
issues including the anonymity issue.  And one thing that we
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 38 of 52

39
have discussed, we filed four cases immediately and since that
1
time our back and forths have led me to believe that by this
2
point we would have something more substantive with respect to
3
this proposal of settlement plan.  And so that’s what we’ve
4
been waiting for.  To some extent at Mr. Moskowitz’s urging,
5
and I don’t really hold him --
6
THE COURT:  You mean before filing more cases?
7
MR. EDWARDS:  Right, before filing.  So that’s
8
what -- we don’t want to cloud the Court with a bunch of cases
9
that ultimately turn out to be unnecessary because they
10
decided to put the entire estate into this plan and it’s going
11
to be a good thing.  So we’re kind of in this limbo not
12
knowing enough information which piggybacks what counsel said
13
a minute ago.  I think once we get clarity, we’ll be able to
14
know are there going to be dozens of other cases that need to
15
be filed or are we going to get somewhere with this
16
resolution.
17
MS. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, I would only add to that we
18
will seek to file anything promptly but as Your Honor may
19
imagine given the circumstances of this case there are women,
20
now grown women, who were victimized by Mr. Epstein who for
21
years and years have kept it hidden living in fear,
22
traumatized by it.  And my law firm, and I’m sure this is true
23
for the other firms, literally get a half dozen calls a day
24
from new women who are reading about this and who say oh my
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 39 of 52

40
God, you know, maybe --
1
THE COURT:  I see.
2
MS. KAPLAN:  And so we can’t control that.  I can
3
promise you that as soon as we learn of people who we think
4
have claims we will do everything we can to file as
5
expeditiously as possible.
6
THE COURT:  You know, there’s some tension obviously
7
between any attorney in an existing case that says we want to
8
move this case and we want to move this case quickly toward
9
trial.  And you know, some desire to have cases handled in
10
some kind of way that’s consistent and not know how many more
11
cases are coming or when they’re coming in.  They don’t have
12
to all be handled the same way.  They don’t all have to be on
13
the same schedule.  It can be sort of a basic concept and then
14
as new cases come in the same sort of concept applies.  But it
15
may be efficient that if someone is deposed, for example, like
16
an executor or someone else on the defendant’s side that the
17
person is not deposed repeatedly.  So you may be able to come
18
up with an agreement that a deposition in one case can be used
19
in another case.  But what if it’s by one counsel and you
20
didn’t have your seat at the table because, you know, you’re a
21
new attorney coming in and you didn’t have a chance to be
22
there?  So when you’re thinking about discovery, think about
23
things like that.  It may make sense to start thinking about
24
proceeding with certain types of document discovery, holding
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 40 of 52

41
off on some depositions certainly on defendants’ side because
1
those may be the same or very similar in a lot of respects. 
2
Obviously, there are going to be individual stories, but some
3
of the kinds of questions that I imagine plaintiffs are going
4
to want to be asking are going to be the same in all the
5
cases.  So use some thought.
6
I’m sending you back with things to think about and
7
things to report back to me on.  I’m not setting any discovery
8
schedules right now.  That doesn’t mean I want the cases to
9
just linger and have nothing happen.  But I think it’s a
10
little bit premature.  I think that it would be -- I just want
11
to pull up a calendar here because I forgot to bring my
12
calendar.  We have holidays coming.  We have obviously
13
Thanksgiving around the corner and then we’re going to hit
14
December, January time frame.  So my computer doesn’t want to
15
bring me a calendar year.  I mean ordinarily I’d say 30 days
16
and get back to me on what’s going on with settlement but
17
that’s going to run into holiday time.  So I mean if you can
18
get back to me with a report before the Christmas holidays
19
hit, that would be great but that may be tight to really have
20
everybody involved at the table and have some discussion going
21
on.  And my erstwhile deputy has brought me my calendar.
22
By the way, this person sitting at the table is
23
Hannah Martin.  She’s one of my law clerks.  If you want to
24
call my chambers about something, she’s a good contact person. 
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 41 of 52

42
I’m sure she’s thrilled to hear me say that.  If you happen to
1
be a member of the press, are any members of the press here? 
2
Look at all these members of the press.  Welcome to my
3
courtroom.  If you have inquiries, please do not call Hannah. 
4
Please call the district executive’s office because if you
5
call us, other than telling you yes it’s true, we have a
6
conference today at 10 o’clock, or something like that, we’re
7
going to steer you to the district executive’s office for
8
press inquiries.  So please just do that in the first
9
instance.  And they’ll contact us if they need information
10
from us to pass along to you.  But for litigants -- all right,
11
so let me look at this calendar.
12
It is now November 21.  Well, what do you think on
13
both sides would be rational for reporting back with respect
14
to status of getting some input on plaintiff’s side, getting
15
information from defendants, all that?
16
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  So on defendants’ side, two things I
17
think are relevant to that, Your Honor, recognizing that we
18
can’t keep, you know, letting things linger because of new
19
cases coming in as you were alluding to.  Currently with
20
respect to cases for which response deadlines to complaints
21
are already set, I believe the last of those response
22
deadlines runs December 20 or something.  So I think it would
23
make sense for getting back to the Court to be sometime after
24
that, not too long.  And obviously, there’s the holidays so
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 42 of 52

43
maybe a couple of weeks after that would make sense.  Also, in
1
terms of timing generally, this will come as no surprise I
2
think to Your Honor, we will, we have and we will continue on
3
my end to work as diligently as possible to promptly provide
4
information that we agree should be provided.  Things do take
5
a little longer given that it’s not just an estate but perhaps
6
the most complex estate that I’m aware of in existence right
7
now.  So to get answers to questions that may in some cases be
8
simple take a little longer in my situation.
9
THE COURT:  I don’t need a status report that says
10
we’ve worked it all out.
11
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Right.
12
THE COURT:  I need a status report that says here’s
13
the progress that has been made on both sides with attorneys
14
on both sides confident that there is in fact progress, that
15
there is in fact a flow of information, that they’re in fact
16
sitting down and talking about things and that they’re
17
learning and that they’re engaged and that they have some
18
hope.  Okay?  That’s what I want to hear.  That’s your
19
mission.  All right?  And on defendants’ side, it is very much
20
in your interest to help facilitate this and try to make sure
21
this happens efficiently because to the extent anyone is
22
holding off on filing new cases to see if in fact there’s a
23
workable plan for settlement that will avoid the need for
24
litigation, the longer it goes where they have doubts that
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 43 of 52

44
that is in fact a workable plan, the more likely they are,
1
especially after what I said about trying to coordinate cases,
2
to just start filing these cases.  I certainly don’t mind -- I
3
can’t speak to statute of limitation issues and whether this
4
period of time would matter or not on those issues, but I
5
don’t mind if you hold off on filing cases if you think that’s
6
fast because you’re optimistic about a settlement fund.  Use
7
your judgment about when you file cases.  I’m not going to
8
direct you when to file them.  But you’ve got a lot of
9
different balls in the air.  You’ve got when cases are going
10
to be filed, how many there are, if discovery should move or
11
should not move, whether they should be coordinated in some
12
way or not, whether certain discovery should go first and
13
other discovery later, whether there are going to be
14
dispositive motions, how that affects whether there should be
15
discovery.  And all of this with this backdrop of talking
16
about settlement.  So I’m thinking maybe we’ll just do one
17
overall status report in all these separate cases before
18
separate judges.  That may be difficult.  Maybe I can at least
19
get for each cluster of plaintiff’s’ lawyers the same letter
20
filed in each of the cases that you have.  If you can all
21
coordinate, so much the better.  If you can’t, you’ll have to
22
put them on the docket separately.  But anyway, status reports
23
on everything, meaning discussions on settlement.  Needless to
24
say, don’t put confidential details about settlement on ECF. 
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 44 of 52

45
Settlement is the one time I’ll hear from you ex parte about
1
things if we really get there.  If you really want to give me
2
details like that, send me something ex parte solely on
3
settlement.  But what I’m looking for at this point is
4
something more general that you think can be on the public
5
docket.  So if you can, please put things on the public
6
docket.  There’s press interest in this case.  Let’s try to
7
have as much on the public docket as we can.  Okay?  But a
8
single report that talks (A) about progress of settlement
9
talks and (B) about a plan for moving forward with the cases. 
10
And if they have to be case specific, they’re case specific. 
11
Do what you think you have to do saving money to the extent
12
you can, breaking it out if necessary.  Use judgment. 
13
Understand that I’d rather have three letters than 53 letters
14
but, you know, I’ll read what I have to read.  Okay?  And how
15
about January 10?  That takes you a couple of weeks past New
16
Year’s.  Everybody okay with that?
17
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Works for defendants, Your Honor.
18
THE COURT:  All right.  Look, if anyone has an
19
immediate need that comes up between now and then, I’m not
20
going anywhere including through the holidays.  I’ll be
21
around.  You can contact my chambers.  Put a letter on ECF. 
22
Yes.
23
MR. GOLDFARB:  Thank you, Judge.  Thank you for
24
allowing us to appear from Miami.  Alan Goldfarb for Jane Doe

17.
1
One suggestion I might offer, Your Honor, is for the
2
next significant hearing I’d like to hear from whoever the
3
claims administrator would be and have some answers here in
4
court so they can participate in explaining this process as to
5
how they see it instead of hunting back and forth as I think
6
might happen.  So I actually was hoping you would have had a
7
pre-Christmas status on that issue alone so we can get some
8
indication, which is almost 30 days from now, Judge, on how
9
that process would work here from the horse’s mouth, and we
10
all hear it at once.  We’re told how this would work, we
11
understand it, and we go back and decide if we accept that or
12
not.  You know, January 10th feels a little long for me for the
13
process.  You’re talking about 90 days.  And I don’t mind
14
coming back up here to your wonderful city again
15
Christmastime.
16
THE COURT:  I didn’t know you were coming but you’re
17
welcome.
18
MR. GOLDFARB:  Thank you.
19
THE COURT:  Basically what we did is we put a notice
20
on the docket on the first group of cases that we were having
21
a conference and then we started reaching out to counsel in
22
later filed cases who seemed to already know that there was a
23
conference.  So we just figured people would show up.  But we
24
didn’t reach out to anyone in Florida.  
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 46 of 52

47
January 10, I’m basically thinking kicking it more
1
than 30 days because of the holidays.  That’s why January 10. 
2
But what I’m thinking ought to happen between now and then, I
3
give it to you for serious consideration, is you folks ought
4
to schedule a meeting without me.  You ought to schedule a
5
meeting with the claims administrators and with counsel in
6
these cases on both sides.  And you ought to sit around a
7
table and you ought to talk about all the questions and get as
8
many answers as you can get and try to gain some confidence
9
that you are all participating and your views are being taken
10
seriously and valued.  And that’s what I think you ought to do
11
because in settlement discussions that’s what happens.  People
12
talk outside of the court about things and try to advance the
13
ball.  And you do have a lot of people.  And if you talk one
14
on one, then you have another one on one with a different
15
lawyer and the message is heard differently or different
16
questions are asked and answered, you know, you’re going to
17
have some confusion reigning.  So I would strongly recommend
18
we not use the courtroom for that meeting at this stage but
19
that you see if you can set one up and literally bring people
20
to the table as a settlement discussion.  And then when you
21
report back, you’ll have something to report back on.  Yes?
22
MR. BOIES:  Your Honor, David Boies.  I agree
23
completely with the Court we need to meet among ourselves. 
24
You got good counsel on both sides here.  I think that we can
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 47 of 52

48
make progress.  However, my consistent experience over, as Ms.
1
Kaplan was saying, over a considerable number of years is that
2
counsel, even with a best faith world, tend to work harder
3
when they’ve got a appearance before the Court in order to
4
respond to where they are.  And I think that if -- I would I
5
think echo what Mr. Goldfarb said which is that if the Court
6
were to set a conference on December 20th just to sort of
7
report on where we were in terms of the settlement process and
8
the administrators, I think that would spur us over the next
9
30 days to maybe work harder and more effectively than if we
10
didn’t have that date.
11
THE COURT:  Are there any attorneys here in the
12
courtroom who do not have your personal calendars with you
13
because they were confiscated at the door?  Do you all have
14
your calendars?
15
MALE SPEAKER:  Yes, Your Honor.
16
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Sure.
17
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  And Your Honor, I mean going back to
18
exactly what you said about just being practical with the
19
holidays, I’m out of state that week, December 20th.
20
THE COURT:  All right.  I’m not scheduling any
21
conference December 20.  But what I suggest is when I step
22
down from the bench I suggest that the attorneys stick around
23
for a minute, compare notes on their availability, see if you
24
can at least tentatively come up with a couple of dates that
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 48 of 52

49
might work for a meeting among you.  You’re going to have to
1
get in touch with the administrators to see if they’re
2
available which is why more than one date would be useful. 
3
See if you can get something on the calendar that’s a firm
4
date to start having real meetings to be able to discuss
5
things with everybody who wants to be involved involved, and
6
everyone could hear everyone else’s questions.  I just don’t
7
think I should be using the courtroom for that at this time.  
8
MS. KAPLAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.  We will.  I
9
think what you’re hearing, if I could speak from the
10
plaintiffs’ side, is we’ve been asking for exactly that
11
meeting now for many weeks, so --
12
THE COURT:  Okay.  So let’s --
13
MS. KAPLAN:  -- that’s why you’re hearing the
14
consternation on our side.
15
THE COURT:  All right.  Well, we don’t want
16
consternation.  We don’t want anybody feeling frustrated.  We
17
want everybody feeling encouraged that there is responsiveness
18
and that this is going to move forward on a track that
19
everybody’s going to be optimistic about.  That’s the goal. 
20
All right?  You are all good counsel and you all understand
21
the need to work together.  And settlement doesn’t happen
22
unless people work together.  So let’s start making that
23
happen.  Try to schedule, you know -- I mean look, you can
24
provide information, you can provide some information in
25
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 49 of 52

50
writing perhaps.  Whatever.  You can start doing that pretty
1
promptly.  But try to schedule a meeting where you start
2
talking about this so that by January 10 it’s not just you met
3
on January 9.  You know, you had a meeting, you started
4
talking, you had some further dialog, you have some progress
5
to report.  That’s the goal to have progress to report.  And I
6
fully agree that having the Court keep tabs makes things
7
happen that doesn’t otherwise happen which is why even at this
8
ridiculously early stage for many of these cases you are all
9
here today because the goal is to take stock of this and to
10
try to oversee this and to try to make these cases move in an
11
appropriate way instead of just having lots of separate
12
squabbles going on, lots of separate issues floating around,
13
different sorts of letters expressing different sorts of
14
frustration.  Right?  We’re going to try to have this as
15
frustration free as possible.  These are serious claims. 
16
Defense counsel recognizes that.  There are a lot of them. 
17
There are more to come.  Let’s see if we can get them on a
18
settlement track that everybody is comfortable with.  And
19
January 10, one letter, 30 letters, whatever it is, try to
20
report back on settlement, on motion practice if there’s going
21
to be motion practice, on discovery proposals if you think
22
discovery is in order and you know, with lots of thought.  And
23
to the extent you differ, I’ll see how you differ.  To the
24
extent you can be of one mind as to how things should proceed,

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 50 of 52

great.  All right?
1
MS. KAPLAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.
2
MR. FUDALI:  Thank you, Your Honor.
3
THE COURT:  It’s a goal.
4
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.
5
THE COURT:  Go forth.  Go forth and do.
