Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen respectfully move for a 
mandatory stay of this action under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k), 
Section 1595(b )(1 ), and alternatively, under this Court's discretionary authority to 
stay civil litigation, based on the existence of a pending federal criminal action. 
Introduction 
This lawsuit arises from a pending federal criminal action concernmg, 
among other things, an alleged assault of the plaintiff. According to her complaint, 
the plaintiff, while a minor, was "recruited . . . to give Epstein a massage for 
monetary compensation," and was "paid ... $300." Am. Compl., ,, 13-15. 1 A 
federal statute directly on point provides that when a civil suit alleging damages to 
a minor victim arises out of the same occurrence as a "criminal action," the civil 
suit "shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the criminal action." 18 U.S.C. § 
1 Jane Doe, a/k/a Jane Doe No. I, is the same plaintiff who previously filed an original civil 
action in this Court, grounded upon diversity jurisdiction, through her father, based on the same 
allegations in this complaint. See Jane Doe No. 1, et al. v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 08-80069-
CIV-MARRA (WPB) (S.D. Fla., filed 1/24/08). Shortly after that lawsuit was filed by her 
father, her mother moved for leave to intervene and to stay, alleging that her father's attorney 
had filed the lawsuit without her consent. Id. at DE 4 (1/29/08) (motion to stay), ,r 4 ("Jane 
Doe's Father filed this lawsuit against Defendant Jeffrey Epstein without the knowledge, 
consultation or consent of Jane Doe No. I."). On February 20, Jane Doe No. I was deposed in 
State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, 50 2006 CF009454A XXXMB (Fla. 15th Cir. Ct.), the 
parallel state-court criminal action (referred to infra at 2, as the "Florida Criminal Action'). 
During that deposition, the plaintiff made numerous admissions that completely undermined the 
allegations against Epstein that she had pied in her complaint. Two days later, her lawyer filed a 
notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice in this Court. See Doe No. 1 v. Epstein, Case No. 
08-CV-80069-KAM (DE 9). Less than three weeks later, on March 6, the plaintiff re-filed the 
instant lawsuit in Florida state court.

3509(k) (emphasis added).2 Accordingly, a stay of this case is mandatory until the 
criminal action arising from the same allegations is no longer pending. 
The Pending Federal Criminal Action 
In 2006, a Florida state grand jury indicted Jeffrey Epstein on allegations 
similar to those in the instant action (State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 
2006 CF 09454A, Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County) (the "Florida 
Criminal Action"). Shortly thereafter, the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (the "USAO") began a federal grand-jury investigation 
into allegations arising out of the same incidents alleged in the instant action ( Grand 
Jury No. 07-103 (WPB), United States District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida) ("the Federal Criminal Action"). 
In September 2007, the USAO and Mr. Epstein entered into a highly unusual 
and unprecedented deferred-prosecution agreement (the "Agreement"), in which the 
USAO agreed to defer (not dismiss or close) the Federal Criminal Action on the 
condition that Mr. Epstein continue to comply with numerous obligations, the first of 
2 The full text of the mandatory-stay provision reads: 
If, at any time that a cause of action for recovery of compensation for damage or 
injury to the person of a child exists, a criminal action is pending which arises out 
of the same occurrence and in which the child is the victim, the civil action shall 
be stayed until the end of all phases of the criminal action and any mention of the 
civil action during the criminal proceeding is prohibited. As used in this 
subsection, a criminal action is pending until its final adjudication in the trial 
court. 
18 U.S.C. § 3509(k).

which was pleading guilty to certain state charges in the Florida Criminal Action. 
The Agreement itself uses the term "deferred'' (rather than "dismissed" or "closed") 
to describe the status of the Federal Criminal Action: 
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prosecution in this 
District, for these offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by 
the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the following 
conditions and the requirements of this Agreement .... 
Agreement, at 2. 
By no stretch did the USAO finalize, close, complete, dismiss or abandon 
the Federal Criminal Action. 
Indeed, as the lead federal prosecutor recently 
explained, the USAO merely "agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of 
prosecution by the State of Florida ... " 
See In re: Jane Doe, Case No. 08-
80736-CIV-Marra/Johnson (S.D. Fla.) (DE 14), Deel. of AUSA Villafana, 
07 /09/08, , 5, attached hereto as Exhibit "A" ( emphasis added). 
Under the 
Agreement, the USAO presently retains the continuing right to indict Mr. Epstein -
~ or to unseal "any" already-existing federal "charges" that may already have been 
handed up by the federal grand jury and sealed - - should he breach any of its 
provisions. Agreement, at 2. 
The period of the deferral continues until three months after Mr. Epstein 
completes service of his sentence in the Florida Criminal Action. Id. Indeed, the

final three months of the Agreement's term constitute an extended period during 
which the USAO expressly retains the ability to evaluate whether Epstein 
committed any breaches of his numerous obligations under the agreement while he 
was serving his state sentence, and, if it so determines, reserves the right to indict 
( or unseal an existing indictment against) Mr. Epstein - - even after he has 
completed serving his entire state sentence. 
The Agreement further provides that upon Epstein's execution of a plea 
agreement in the State Criminal Case, the Federal Criminal Action "will be 
suspended" and all pending grand-jury subpoenas "will he held in abeyance unless 
and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement." Agreement, at 5 
( emphasis added). The Agreement directs the USAO and Epstein to "maintain 
their evidence, specifically evidence requested by or directly related to the grand 
jury subpoenas that have been issued," and to maintain such evidence "inviolate." 
Id. 
( emphasis added). It also expressly provides that the grand-jury subpoenas 
continue to remain "outstanding" until "the successful completion of the terms of 
this agreement." Id. ( emphasis added). 
Further, it includes a promise not to prosecute movant/defendant Sarah 
Kellen, only if "Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of th[ e] 
agreement." Id.

Finally, the Agreement provides that the USAO's declination of prosecution 
for certain enumerated offenses and dismissal of any existing (sealed) charges will 
not occur until 90 days following the completion of his state sentence: 
If the United States Attorney should determine, based on 
reliable evidence, that, during the period of the Agreement, Epstein 
willfully violated any of the conditions of this Agreement, then the 
United States Attorney may, within ninety (90) days following the 
expiration of the term of home confinement discussed below, provide 
Epstein with timely notice specifying the condition(s) of the 
Agreement that he has violated, and shall initiate its prosecution on 
any offense within sixty (60) days' of [sic] giving notice of the 
violation. Any notice provided to Epstein pursuant to this paragraph 
shall be provided within 60 days of the United States learning of facts 
which may provide a basis for a determination of a breach of the 
Agreement. 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of 
this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of 
the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the 
United States Attorney's Office, nor any offenses that arose from the 
Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District, and 
the charges against Epstein, if any, will be dismissed. 
Agreement, at 2. 
Consistent with the Agreement and its position that the Federal Criminal 
Action continues to remain pending, the USAO recently sent letters to attorneys for 
people that the USAO has designated as "victims." In those letters, the USAO 
asked, "[I]fyou do file a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and Mr. Epstein denies that 
your client is a victim of an enumerated offense, please provide notice of that

denial to the undersigned [AUSA]." See Deel. of AUSA Villafana, Exhs. 6 & 7, at 
2 (July 9, 2008). The clear implication of the USAO's request (by which the 
USAO appears to involve itself in the instant litigation, despite advising the 
recipients that it cannot "take part in or otherwise assist in civil litigation," id. at 2), 
is that the USAO believes that such denial might breach the Agreement. 
Accordingly, the Federal Criminal Action remains "pending." 
Discussion 
I. 
Section 3509(k) Imposes a Mandatory Stay. 
The language of Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k) is clear and 
mandatory: a parallel "civil action shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the 
criminal action." 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added). The word "shalf' means 
that the statute's command is mandatory and not subject to a Court's discretion. 
See, e.g., Lopez v. Davis, 531 U.S. 230, 241 (2001) (noting Congress' "use of a 
mandatory 'shall' to impose discretionless obligations") ( emphasis added); 
Lexecon Inc. v. Mi/berg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26, 35 (1998) 
(explaining that "the mandatory 'shall' ... normally creates an obligation 
impervious to judicial discretion") (emphasis added). Cf Miller v. French, 530 
U.S. 327, 350 (2000) (construing the litigation-stay provision of the Prison 
Litigation Reform Act, holding, "Through the PLRA, Congress clearly intended to 
make operation of the automatic stay mandatory, precluding courts from

exercising their equitable powers to enjoin the stay. And we conclude that this 
provision does not violate separation of powers principles.") ( emphasis added). 
One District Court within the Eleventh Circuit recently construed "the plain 
language of§ 3509(k)" as "requirfingj a stay in a case ... where ... a parallel 
criminal action [is] pending." Doe v. Francis, No. 5:03 CV 260, 2005 WL 950623, 
at *2 (N.D. Fla. Apr. 20, 2005) (Francis II) ( emphasis added). Accord Doe v. 
Francis, No. 5:03 CV 260, 2005 WL 517847, at *1-2 (N.D. Fla. Feb. 10, 2005) 
(Francis I) (staying federal civil action in favor of "a criminal case currently 
pending in state court in Bay County, Florida, arising from the same facts and 
involving the same parties as the Instant action," noting that "the language of 18 
U.S.C. § 3509(k) is clear that a stay is required in a case such as this where a 
parallel criminal action is pending which arises from the same occurrence 
involving minor victims") ( emphasis added). There is no contrary opinion from 
any court. 
In determining that the federal stay provision is mandatory, the Francis II 
court expressed that there was apparently no case law supporting, or even 
"discussing the [avoidance] of a stay [under the command of] § 3509(k)." Francis 
II, 2005 WL 950623, at *2. Deferring to the statute as written, the Francis II court 
rejected the plaintiffs' argument that some of the alleged victims had already 
reached their majority. 
See id. 
The court similarly rejected the plaintiffs'

argument that it would be in the victims' best interests to avoid a stay so as to 
counteract the victims' "ongoing and increasing mental harm due to the 'frustrating 
delay in both the criminal case and [the civil] case."' Id. 
II. 
Section 3509(k) Applies to Investigations, Not Just Indictments. 
While there is no unsealed indicted criminal case against Mr. Epstein, the 
government's criminal investigation against him remains open. Section 3509(k) 
clearly applies to stay civil cases during the pendency, not only of indicted 
criminal cases, but also of pre-indictment criminal investigations. 
The term "criminal action" is not expressly defined in § 3509(k). It is 
defined, however, by a closely related statute. Title 18, U.S.C. § 1595 provides a 
civil remedy for "forced labor" and "sex trafficking" violations, but stays such 
actions "during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same 
occurrence in which the claimant is the victim."3 In enacting § 1595, Congress 
3 The full text of that statute provides: 
§ 1595. Civil remedy 
(a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of section 1589, 
1590, or 1591 of this chapter may bring a civil action against 
the perpetrator in an appropriate district court of the United 
States and may recover damages and reasonable attorneys 
fees. 
(b) 
(1) 
Any civil action filed under this section shall be 
stayed during the pendency of any criminal action 
arising out of the same occurrence in which the 
claimant is the victim.

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 10 of 45
specifically intended that the term "criminal action" would be applied extremely 
broadly. Accordingly, Congress took pains to ensure that courts would give it the 
broadest possible construction and, for that reason, specified in the definition 
provision that "criminal action" also "includes investigation." 
18 u.s.c. 
§ 1595(b )(2 ). The only reported decision addressing this provision interpreted it 
according to its plain language. See Ara v. Khan, No. CV 07-1251, 2007 WL 
1726456, *2 (E.D.N.Y. June 14, 2007) (ordering "all proceedings in this case 
stayed pending the conclusion of the government's criminal investigation of the 
defendants and of any resulting criminal prosecution") ( emphasis added). 
Given that the USAO's Agreement with Epstein indicates that: 
• 
the grand-jury's subpoenas remain "outstanding" (Agreement, at 5); 
• 
the subpoenas are "h[ e ]ld ... in abeyance" (id.); 
• 
the subpoenas are not "withdrawn" (id.); 
• 
the parties must "maintain their evidence" (id.) ( which would be 
entirely unnecessary if the investigation against Epstein were closed); 
18 U.S.C. § 1595. 
(2) 
In this subsection, a "criminal action" includes 
investigation and prosecution and is pending until 
final adjudication in the trial court. 
4 The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit routinely relies on Black's Law 
Dictionary for the definition of statutory terms, including in criminal cases. See e.g., United 
States v. Young, 528 F .3d 1294, 1297 n.3 ( 11th Cir. 2008) ( definitions of criminal "complaint" 
and "indictment"); United States v. Brown, 526 F.3d 691, 705 (11th Cir. 2008) (definition of 
"knowingly" in criminal statute).

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 11 of 45
• 
"any" existing "charges" will not "be dismissed" until after Epstein 
has "timely fulfill[ ed] all the terms and conditions of the Agreement" 
(id. at 2); and 
• 
"prosecution in this District ... shall be deferred" (id.) (but not closed 
or dismissed) - -
then the only reasonable conclusion is that the Federal Criminal Action remains 
"pending." 
The ordinary meaning of the adjective "pending" is "[r]emaining undecided; 
awaiting decision .... " Black's Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed. 2004). 4 See also 
White v. Klitzkie, 281 F .3d 920, 928 (9th Cir. 2002) (relying on Black's Law 
Dictionary, in the context of a criminal case, for the definition of "pending" as 
"awaiting decision"); Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 421 (3d Cir. 2000) (relying 
on Black's Law Dictionary for the definition of "pending," expressly because 
"'pending' is not defined in the statute"). Any common-sense reading of the 
Agreement and the USAO's recent sworn construction of it, is consonant with the 
Federal Criminal Action's "remaining undecided" and "awaiting decision." See 
Unified Gov 't of Athens-Clarke County v. Athens Newspapers, LLC, No. 
S07G 1133, _S.E.2d _, 2008 WL 2579238, *3 (Ga. June 30, 2008) (reviewing a

not yet resulted in a prosecution logically "remains undecided," and is therefore 
"pending," until it "is concluded and the file closed'') ( emphasis added). 
III. 
Section 3509(k) Applies Even After a Plaintiff Turns 18. 
The parallel stay provision in § 1595, discussed supra at 8-9, mandates, 
without exception, that any civil action brought under that section for violation of 
§ 1591 (prohibiting transportation of minors for prostitution) "shall be stayed 
during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same occurrence in 
which the claimant is the victim." 18 U.S.C. § 159l(b)(l). Whether the§ 1595 
plaintiff has turned 18 does not vitiate the efficacy of this mandatory stay. 
An example illustrates why the stay provided in § 3509(k) has the same 
broad scope as the stay provided in § 15 91 (b )(1 ). As discussed above, § 3 5 09(k) 
stays any civil suit for injury to a minor, arising out of the same occurrence as a 
pending criminal action. One type of civil suit falling within § 3509(k)'s ambit is a 
suit seeking redress for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Section 2423(a) - - just 
like § 1591 - - prohibits transportation of minors for prostitution. The elements of 
both statutes are identical. There would simply be no legitimate basis for Congress 
to differentiate between the consequences attached to violating these two sections. 
Thus, just as Congress mandated under § 1595(b )(1) that civil discovery shall be 
stayed when there is an ongoing federal investigation under § 15 91 ( even after the 
11 
LeY\'_is_ Tein Pl.

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 13 of 45
victim turns 18), the identical treatment should· apply under § 3509(k) to civil 
actions brought for the identical violation of§ 2423(a). 
Logic compels a rule requiring continued application of the§ 3509(k) stay to 
a putative victim who has since turned 18. 
Consider again the example of 
§ 2243(a). Assume that the USAO is investigating a § 2243(a) violator with two 
alleged victims; one who is now 17, and one who has turned 19. Assume further 
that both decide to sue the alleged offender while the USAO is still in the process 
of conducting its criminal investigation. 
Why would Congress prohibit the 
defendant from conducting civil discovery in the 17-year-old's lawsuit, but permit 
him to conduct full discovery in the 19-year-old's lawsuit, including taking the 
depositions of both the 19- and the 17-year-old, the federal investigating agents 
and all the grand-jury witnesses? This could not have been Congress' intent. 
The legislative history to a statute resembling § 1595 is also instructive. 
When Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. § 2255, it provided a civil remedy to any 
"minor ... victim" of enumerated federal sex offenses. See Child Abuse Victims' 
Rights Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-500, 100 Stat. 1783, § 703 (1986). In 2006, 
Congress amended the statute to clarify that the civil cause of action was available 
not just while the victim was a minor, but even after she or he turned 18. See Pub. 
L. 109-248, 120 Stat. 650, § 707 (b)(l)(A) (amending § 2255 to permit suit by 
adults who were victims of enumerated federal offenses when they were minors,

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 14 of 45
by deleting "Any minor who is [ a victim]" and adding "Any person, who, while a 
minor, was [a victim]"). 
Meanwhile, the stay provisions of§ 3509(k) remained 
unchanged. There is no reason to think that Congress would afford prosecutors 
protection for their investigations while the victims were minors, but completely 
eliminate those protections the moment one of the victims turned 18. 
The District Court for the Northern District of Florida confirmed this 
position, and specifically rejected the plaintiffs' contrary argument. See Francis II, 
2005 WL 950623, at *2. The plaintiffs there argued that "the stay should be lifted 
due to the fact that the minor Plaintiffs have now reached the age of majority 
during the pendency of the state criminal case." 
Id. 
The court found this 
argument "unavailing ... given the victims' minor status at the time of the events 
giving rise to the underlying claims." Id. The court specifically held that "because 
the victims were minors at the time of the Defendants' actions alleged in both 
[the civil and criminal] cases, § 3509(k) applies." Id. ( emphasis added). 
The United States Department of Justice has itself emphatically embraced 
the interpretation of§ 3509(k) as applying to stay all civil actions relating to sex 
offenses against minors, pending the completion of a parallel criminal action, 
without regard to whether the plaintiff has turned 18 during her civil lawsuit: 
The subsection should stay all pending civil actions in the wake of a 
criminal prosecution. Notably, in the context of 18 USC § 2255 ("civil 
remedy for personal injuries"), all civil actions are stayed pending the

completion of a criminal action. See also 18 USC § 3509(k). 
H.R. Rep. 108-264(11), 108th Cong., 1st Sess. (2003), reprinted at 2003 WL 
22272907, at * 16-17 ("agency view" by the Department of Justice on bill later 
codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1595). 
The Department specifically argued to Congress in the clearest terms: "We 
believe that prosecutions should take priority over civil redress and that 
prosecutions should be complete prior to going forward with civil suits." Id. at 17 
( emphasis added). Nowhere did the Department suggest that pending prosecutions 
warrant less protection (i.e., should be "hinder[ ed]") simply because a particular 
civil plaintiff happens to reach his or her 18th birthday. 
Finally, it would be incongruous for the plaintiff to claim that § 3509(k) is 
no longer applicable to her because she is no longer a minor, but, at the very same

her identity because the Complaint makes sensitive allegations of sexual assault 
and abuse that she suffered while a minor." Am. Comp!., ,12 ( emphasis added). 
IV. 
A Stay is Mandatory Despite Resulting "Delay" to Civil Lawsuits. 
Inherent in any § 3509(k) stay is delay to the progress ( discovery, trial, 
appeal) of all related civil lawsuits. Congress recognized this in enacting the stay 
provision, which necessarily prioritized the interests of completing a criminal 
investigation and prosecution over the interests of a particular plaintiff in seeking

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 16 of 45
personal pecuniary damages. 
Based on this reasoning, the Francis II court 
specifically refused to provide any relief to plaintiffs "simply because the state 
[ criminal] matter is not progressing as fast as they would hope." The court made 
this determination despite the plaintiffs' complaints about the "frustrating delay" 
and that "the state criminal case 'has languished for almost two years with no end 
in sight,"' finding that this "is a matter to be addressed in state [ criminal] court." 
Id Accordingly, the anticipated delay in this case, attendant to the term of the 
deferred-prosecution agreement, does not change the clear command of§ 3509(k). 
According to her own pleadings, the plaintiff waited three years before filing 
this lawsuit, Am. Comp!. ,-i 9, and so cannot rightfully claim prejudice from 
additional temporary delay. 
V. 
Section 3509 Aside, a Discretionary Stay is Warranted. 
Even, arguendo, were this Court not to apply the mandate of § 3509, a 
discretionary stay should still be entered during the pendency of the Federal 
Criminal Action. SEC v. Healthsouth Corp., 261 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1326 (N.D. 
Ala. 2003) ("No question exists that this court has the power to stay a civil 
proceeding due to an active, parallel criminal investigation."). 
Other federal 
statutes support such a stay -- particularly when the criminal action may be 
adversely affected by the civil litigation. 
For example, under 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2 712( e )(1 ), "the court shall stay any action commenced [ against the United

States] if the court determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability 
of the Government to conduct a related investigation or prosecution of a related 
criminal case." Allowing this lawsuit to progress while Epstein remains subject to 
the Federal Criminal Action will prejudice him irrevocably and irreparably. As 
provided below, there are several adverse effects to allowing this case to proceed 
while the Federal Criminal Action remains pending. 
In this lawsuit, Epstein has a right to defend himself. 
In the Federal 
Criminal Action, Epstein has a right against self-incrimination. Hoffman v. United 
States, 341 U.S. 479,486 (1951) (holding that the privilege applies in "instances 
where the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend danger" of criminal 
liability"). Without a stay, Epstein will be immediately forced to abandon one of 
these rights. 
Should he choose his Fifth Amendment rights, he will expose himself to an 
adverse inference at the summary-judgment stage and at trial. 
See generally, 
Wehling v. Columbia Broad. Sys, 611 F.2d 1026, 1027 (5th Cir. 1980) (observing 
that "invocation of the privilege would be subject to the drawing of an adverse 
inference by the trier of fact"). On the other hand, should Epstein choose his right 
to defend himself in this lawsuit, the USAO will be able to use his responses at 
every stage of the discovery and trial process (e.g., his Answer, responses to 
document requests, responses to requests for admissions, sworn answers to

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 18 of 45
interrogatories, answers to deposition questions, and trial testimony) to his 
detriment in the Federal Criminal Action. 
5 
In this lawsuit, even before civil discovery begins, under the Initial 
Disclosures required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 and S.D. Fla. Local Rule 26.1, Epstein 
"must" disclose the identities of all the witnesses he would call in his defense to 
the Federal Criminal Action (Rule 26(a)(l )(A)(i)), copies of "all documents" he 
"may use to support [his] defenses" (Rule 26(a)(l )(A)(ii)), as well as the identity 
of "any" expert witness he "may use at trial," along with mandatory disclosure of 
"a written report" containing "a complete statement of all opinions the [ expert] will 
express and the basis and reasons for them" (Rule 26(a)(2)(A) and (B)(i)). 
In contrast, in the pending Federal Criminal Action, which is governed 
exclusively by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the USAO would not be 
entitled to compel pre-trial production of any of this information. See Fed. R. Cr. 
P. 16(b)(l)(A), (C), and 16(b)(2); United States v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 
1355-56 (11th Cir. 1991) ( explaining act-of-production privilege). 
5 This could give the USAO a tremendous advantage in prosecuting Epstein in the Federal 
Criminal Action. See Comment, Using Equitable Powers to Coordinate Parallel Civil and 
Criminal Actions, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1023, 1030 (1985) (observing that "the prosecutor may have 
access to detailed civil depositions of the accused's witnesses, while the rules of criminal 
procedure bar the accused from deposing the prosecutor's witnesses").

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 19 of 45
Thus, absent a stay of this civil action, the USAO would receive 
fundamentally unfair access to defense information and highly prejudicial advance 
insight into criminal defense strategy. See Comment, 98 Harv. L. Rev. at 1030 
("To the extent that a prosecutor acquires evidence that was elicited from the 
accused in a parallel civil proceeding, the criminal process becomes less 
adversarial."). 
Without a stay m place, discovery will proceed, including against third 
parties. 
Mr. Epstein will have no alternative but to issue subpoenas seeking 
evidence from state and federal law-enforcement officers. For example, Epstein is 
clearly entitled to discover evidence of prior statements (including inconsistent 
statements) given by witnesses whom law-enforcement has previously interviewed. 
See, e.g., Cox v. Treadway, 75 F.3d 230 (6th Cir. 1996) (holding that district court 
properly admitted testimony of prosecutor about prior inconsistent statements that 
witness made to the prosecutor). Likewise, Epstein may be entitled to discovery of 
relevant evidence that is in the present possession of the grand jury or other law-
enforcement agencies. See, e.g., Simpson v. Hines, 729 F. Supp. 526, 527 (E.D. 
Tex. 1989) ("The grand jury has concluded its deliberations .... The need for 
secrecy of these specific tapes no longer outweighs other concerns."); Golden 
Quality Ice Cream Co., Inc. v. Deerfield Specialty Papers, Inc., 87 F.R.D. 53, 59 
(E.D. Pa. 1980) ("[W]here, as here, the grand jury has completed its work and all

that is sought are those documents turned over to the grand jury by the 
corporations which are defendants in the civil case, the considerations . 
militating against disclosure are beside the point.") ( citing Douglas Oil Co. of 
Calif v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211 (1979)). 
In response to such third-party subpoenas to law-enforcement witnesses, we 
anticipate that it will be the government, not Mr. Epstein, who will object to 
discovery m this civil case, until the final conclusion of the Federal Criminal 
Action.

Conclusion 
Because this lawsuit arises from the same allegations as the Federal Criminal

TO VICTIM'S EMERGENCY PETITION FOR ENFORCEMENT

I. 
I, A. Marie Villafana, do hereby declare that I am a member in good standing 
of the Bar of the State of Florida. I graduated from the University of California at Berkeley 
School of Law (Boalt Hall) in 1993. After serving as a judicial clerk to the Hon. David F. 
Levi in Sacramento, California, I was admitted to practice in California in 1995. I also am 
admitted to practice in all courts of the states of Minnesota and Florida, the Eig~th, Eleventh, 
and Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District 
of Florida, the District of Minnesota, and the Northern District of California. My bar 
admission status in California and Minnesota is currently inactive. I am currently employed 
as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of Florida and was so 
employed during all of the events described herein.

2. 
I am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"). 
The federal investigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police 
Department ("PBPD") into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had 
used facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and 
seventeen to engage in prostitution, amongst other offenses. 
3. 
Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification 
letters were provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBI's Victim-Witness 
Specialist. Attached hereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards' three 
clients, T.M., C.W., and S.R. 1 Your Affiant's letter to C.W. was provided by the FBI. (Ex. 
1 ). Your Affiant's letter to T.M. was hand-delivered by myself to T.M. at the time that she 
,..-as interviewed (Ex. 2).2 Both C.W. and T.M. also received letters from the FBI's Victim-
Witness Specialist, which were sent on January I 0, 2008 (Exs. 3 & 4 ). S.R. was identified 
via the FBI's investigation in 2007, but she initially refused to speak with investigators. 
S.R.'s status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by 
1Attorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of "Jane Doe," without identifying which of 
his clients is the purported victim. Accordingly, I will address facts related to C. W., T.M., and S .R. 
All three of those clients were victims of Jeffrey Epstein's while they were minors beginning when 
they were fifteen years old. 
2Please nott: that the dates on the U.S. Attorney's Office letters to C. W. and T.M. are not the 
dates that the letteni were actually delivered. Letters to all known victims were prepared early in the 
investigation and delivered as each victim was contacted.

federal agents on May 28, 2008. The FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist sent a letter to S.R. 
on May 30, 2008 (Ex. 5). 
4. 
Throughout the investigation, the FBI agents, the FBI's Victim-Witness 
Specialist, and your Affiant had contact with C. W. and S.R. Attorney Edwards' other client, 
T.M., was represented by counsel and, accordingly, all contact with T.M. was made through 
that attorney. That attorney was James Eisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, 
the target of the investigation. 3 
5. 
In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida ("the Office") entered into negotiations to resolve the 
investigation. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with 
solicitation of prostitution, in violation ofFlorida Statutes§ 796.07. Mr. Epstein's attorneys 
sought a global resolution of the matter. The United States subsequently agreed to defer 
federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as certain basic 
preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a 
federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one 
condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008, is 
the following: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense 
enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same 
rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein 
3The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing T.M. or whether 
TM. ever fonnally terminated Mr. Eisenberg's representation.

had been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes 
of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein•~ 
attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an 
Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial 
authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining 
which eviclentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is 
the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position 
as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no 
less." 
6. 
An agreement was reached in September 2007. The Agreement contained an 
express confidentiality provision. 
7. 
Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, 
several had expressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they 
desired a prompl resolution of the matter. 
At the time the agreement was signed in 
September2007, T.M. was openly hostile to the prosecution of Epstein. The FBI attempted 
to interview S.R. in October 2007, at which time she refused to provide any information 
regarding Jeffrey Epstein. None of Attorney Edwards' clients had expressed a desire to be 
consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation. 
8. 
As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution 
to the State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, 
shortly after the agreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions 
were discussed. One of those victims was C. W. who at the time was not represented, and she 
was given notice of the agreement. Notice was also provided ofan expected change of plea 
in October 2007. When Epstein's attorneys learned that some of the victims had been

notified, they complained that the victims were receiving an incentive to overstate their 
involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their damages claims. While your Affiant 
knew that the victims' statements had been taken and corroborated with independent 
evidence well before they were informed of the potential for damages, the agents and I 
concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the witnesses' credibility at 
trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement. 
9. 
After C.W. had been notified of the terms of the agreement, but before Epstein 
performed his obligations, C.W. contacted the FBI because Epstein's counsel was attempting 
to take her deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Your Affiant secured pro 
bono counsel to represent C.W. and several other identified victims. Pro bono counsel was 
able to assist C.W. in avoiding the improper deposition. That pro bono counsel did not 
express to your Affiant that C. W. was dissatisfied with the resolution of the matter. 
I 0. 
In mid-June 2008, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affiant to inform me that 
he represented C.W. and S.R. and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding 
Epstein. I invited Attorney Edwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to 
consider. Nothing was provided. I also advised Attorney Edwards that he should consider 
contacting the State Attorney's Office, ifhe so wished. I understand that no contact with that 
office was made. Attorney Edwards had alluded to T.M., so I advised him that, to my 
knowledge, T.M. was still represented by Attorney James Eisenberg.

On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Affiant received a 
copy of the proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 
a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. 
Your Affiant and the Palm Beach Police Department 
attempted to provide notification to victims in the short time that Epstein· s counsel had given 
us. Although all known victims were not notified, your Affiant specifically called attorney 
Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. Your Affiant believes that 
it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards notified me that he represented T.M., 
and I assumed that he would pass on the notice to her, as well. Attorney Edwards informed 
your Affiant that he could not attend but that someone would be present at the hearing. Your 
Affiant attended the hearing, but none of Attorney Edwards' clients was present. 
12. 
On today's date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to 
C. W. and S.R. via their attorney, Bradley Edwards (Exs. 6 & 7). A notification was not 
provided to T.M. because the U.S. Attorney's modification limited Epstein's liability to 
victims whom the United States was prepared to name in an indictment. In light ofT.M. 's 
prior statements to law enforcement, your Affiant could not in good faith include T.M. as a 
victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the list provided to 
Epstein's counsel. 
13. 
Furthermore, with respect to the Certification ofEmergency, Attorney Edwards 
did not ever contact me prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he 
requests in his Emergency Petition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had
