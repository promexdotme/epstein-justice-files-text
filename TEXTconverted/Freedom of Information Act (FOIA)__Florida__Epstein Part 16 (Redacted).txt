EXAMINATION 
17 	
BY DET. RECAREY: 
18 	
Q. 	
Mr. Alessi, I'm Detective Joe Recarey with 
19 	
the Palm Beach P.D. As I explained to you on the 
20 telephone, I am conducting an investigation on a former 
21 	
employer of yours. 
22 	
I just spoke with your wife and she told me 
23 you guys worked for Mr. Epstein for eight years? 
24 	
A. 	
Yes, she did work for eight years. I 
25 	
worked longer. I was there before my wife came.

Q. 	
Before your wife came. 
2 	
A. 	
I started full-time with him on January 1, 
3 	
1991, and we both left December 31, 2002. So I worked 
4 	
eleven years exactly. Prior to that, prior to working 
5 	
full-time for him, I worked part-time for him, on-and-off 
6 	
basis. 
	
7 	
Q. 	
What were your responsibilities? 
8 	
A. 	
In the full-time basis, I started as a 
9 houseman, and I became a major domo and butler and 
10 everything else, driver, and did everything. We both did 
11 	
all the chores in the house, but I was in charge of the 
12 house. I was above my wife and above the cleaning crew, 
13 	
the gardners, pool people. So I was house manager, major 
14 	
domo. 
15 	
Q. 	
You would have been the go-to guy for the 
16 	
house? 
17 	
A. 	
Yes. And the one who would get the blame. 
18 	
Q. 	
We are talking about Jeffrey Epstein? 
19 	
A. 	
Of course. 
20 	
Q. 	
Do you remember the address of the house? 
21 	
A. 	
558 El Brillo. 
22 	
Q. 	
Was it in the beginning of the street -- 
23 	
A. 	
At the end of the street, on the left-hand 
24 	
side. 
25 	
Q. 	
We're talking about the same house.

Q. 
5 	
A. 
6 	
Q. 
Yeah. 
Your wife said the same number you did. 
558? 358? 558? 
It was 358. 
We left three years ago. 
And I understand it's been some time since 
7 	
then. So the questions I'm going to ask you basically 
8 	
is: During your time, did you deal directly with 
9 	
Mr. Epstein? 
10 	
A. 	
Yes. And her -- and her -- girlfriend, 
11 manager. She was the manager of all the households, 
12 because he has homes all over the world. 
13 	
Q. 	
Right. 
14 	
A. 	
So we have -- she was my boss, and I deal 
15 	
directly with her. 
16 	
Q. 	
Who was -- 
17 	
A. 	
Elaine Maxwell. 
18 	
Q. 	
Ms. Maxwell, that's his girlfriend, 
19 	
correct? 
20 	
A. 	
Um-hum. 
21 	
Q. 	
During the eleven years, he would come 
22 down, she would inform you that they were coming down? 
23 	
A. 	
Right. 
24 	
Q. 	
Make arrangements to have the house ready? 
25 	
A. 	
Right.

Q. 	
During the time that he was here, you 
2 	
prepared the house, did all the chores. 
3 	
Did you do any of the cleaning? 
4 	
A. 	
Sometimes. Many times. I did -- last two 
5 or three years the work was so much that we have to 
6 	
hire 	
we hire a clean-up crew that they came twice a 
7 	
week or once a week, then it was twice a week. Depends 
8 	
upon his schedule, because he did not allow anybody at 
9 	
the house except us when he was in town. So when he was 
10 	
in town, it was just us doing the cleaning and the 
11 	
cooking, the driving, shopping, everything else. 
12 	
Q. 	
Did you stay on property in the guest 
13 	
house? 
14 	
A. 	
Yes and no. We had an apartment right 
15 	
across the bridge. We had an apartment in Tower 1515 on 
16 	
Flagler, and we had an apartment at the house. 
17 	
Q. 	
Why would you stay at the house, then? 
18 	
A. 	
We stay at the house mostly when he was 
19 there. When he was not in town, we went home. We went 
20 	
to our apartment. When he was there, it was -- the job 
21 	
was just too much to go home 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock and 
22 	
come back 5 o'clock in the morning. We would just stay 
23 	
and sleep and get up and work. 
24 	
Q. 	
When he was in town, did he receive a lot 
25 	
of guests at the house?

1 	
A. 	
Yes. Many, many, many guests. It was 
2 	
never with no guests. 
3 	
Q. 	
Did he have assistants with him? 
4 	
A. 	
Assistants? At the last year he had an 
5 	
assistant just for him. They would travel with him all 
6 the time. At the last -- in the last two years of my 
7 	
stay there, he also have a chef, a gourmet chef that he 
8 	
would travel with him. That's it. 
9 	
Q. 	
Do you remember the chef's name? 
10 	
A. 	
There were quite a few. The last one I 
11 	
know is Adam Perry. P-E-R-R-Y, I think. And he was from 
12 	
New York. 
13 	
And there was another French chef, Didier 
14 	
(phonetic); I don't know his last name. 
15 	
And there was another English chef. But 
16 	
they went quickly. 
17 	
Q. 	
They would come and go, come and go. 
18 	
What about the assistant that was his 
19 personal assistant that would fly with him? 
20 	
A. 	
Annie Taylor. It was an English girl that 
21 would travel with him a lot, and became the personal 
22 	
assistant. But most of the time it was Ms. Maxwell that 
23 traveled with him all the time. 
24 	
Q. 	
She was basically like his -- 
25 	
A. 	
Girlfriend, whatever it was. Boss,

girlfriend. She was our immediate superior. 
2 	
Q. 	
Did he have girls come over to give 
3 massages? 
4 	
A. 	
Yes. 
5 	
Q. 	
How many massages would he have in a day? 
6 	
A. 	
Sometimes one, sometimes two, three. 
7 	
Q. 	
Was it the same girl that would come back 
8 	
to do the massages? 
9 	
A. 	
Yeah, yeah. Not the same girl 	
I mean 
10 during eleven years, I probably saw a hundred, two 
11 	
hundred different massage therapists. 
12 	
Q. 	
Did they seem young to you? 
13 	
A. 	
No, sir. Mostly no. We saw one or two 
14 	
young ones in the last year. Before that, it was all 
15 	
adults. 
16 	
Q. 	
During your last year when you were working 
17 with him, what do you mean that they looked young? Did 
18 	
they look like they were still in high school? 
19 	
A. 	
I remember one girl was young. We never 
20 	
asked how old she was. It was not in my job. 
21 	
Q. 	
Right. I understand. 
22 	
A. 	
But I imagine she was 16, 17. In my 
23 	
judgment, she was 16, 17. 
24 	
Q. 	
Where would these massages take place? 
25 	
A. 	
All the time it was in his room. Sometimes

it was in the balcony of his quarters. His room has a 
2 	
wraparound balcony facing the pool. So the massages were 
3 	
in the balcony outside in the sun, or inside in his 
4 bathroom or her bathroom. 
5 	
Q. 	
Would you set up the room for the massages? 
6 	
A. 	
Many times. Yes, he will tell me, Set up 
7 the room inside my bathroom or in the bedroom or in 
8 	
Elaine's bathroom, or outside on the balcony. And I 
9 would go and set up or my wife would go and set up the 
10 	
table. 
11 	
We had a table in every room of the house, 
12 	
the massage tables, for the different guests. Because 
13 not only he got massages, all the other guests got 
14 massages too. So we have a table -- massage table in 
15 basically every room, guest room. 
16 	
Q. 	
The girls that would come over to do 
17 massages, they would massage him first or massage guests? 
18 	
A. 	
Different times. There were -- mostly they 
19 was his massage. Mostly he would get massages. 
20 	
Q. 	
Would Ms. Maxwell be in the room with him 
21 while he was getting the massage? 
22 	
A. 	
We don't know. Apparently we saw her going 
23 upstairs, because it was -- when they went upstairs, they 
24 	
closed -- his quarters, it had a double door, so it was a 
25 door on top of the stairs -- I don't know if you've been

1 	
in the house -- and then there's another door going into 
2 	
his room. So it was a long corridor. So everything was 
3 	
closed and nobody saw anything. 
4 	
Q. 	
Would you clean up after? 
5 	
A. 	
Once in a while, yes, I did. Most of the 
6 	
times I did. I did the cleanup. 
7 	
Q. 	
Did it appear as if there was going to be 
8 more than one massage going on in the room? 
9 	
A. 	
More than one massage? I don't know. It 
10 was massages. There was massages, because it was a hot 
11 	
oil, and it was -- you know this vibrator, the neck 
12 	
vibrators with the long handles. And towels, a lot of 
13 towels. We used a lot of towels in the house. Used like 
14 maybe 40, 50 towels a day, because every time he go in 
15 	
into the pool, it was two or three towels. Everything 
16 had to be cleaned up. I went most of the time to pick up 
17 	
the room and get it ready. 
18 	
Q. 	
Did it ever appear to you that more went on 
19 in the room other than a massage? 
20 	
A. 	
I just imagine. I never saw anything. But 
21 	
I imagine there was more than -- I never saw anything 
22 because it was closed doors. It was never done outside. 
23 	
Q. 	
Based on the cleanup? 
24 	
A. 	
Based on the cleanup -- at the end, I 
25 cannot say there was. At the end, it was a few times

that the bed was undone. You know, we make the beds 
2 	
three or four times a day. And sometimes we went to 
3 	
clean up the massage to put it back, the massage table, 
4 	
to pick up the towels, but the bed was undone again. So 
	
5 	
either he took a nap or he went for a nap, I don't know. 
	
6 	
Q. 	
Or something else occurred? 
7 	
A. 	
Or something else. I cannot. 
8 	
Q. 	
Did the girls, would they bring their own 
9 	
stuff or they would use his stuff? 
10 	
A. 	
No. We had everything. We had gallons of 
11 	
stuff, different stuff. 
12 	
Q. 	
Different massage oils? 
13 	
A. 	
Different, all kinds. 
14 	
Q. 	
Different massagers? 
15 	
A. 	
Different stuff. 
16 	
They would buy all over the world different 
17 	
types of -- for different -- 
18 	
Q. 	
Did any of these massagers look like sex 
19 	
toys? 
20 	
A. 	
At the end, at the last year that we were 
21 	
there they had like sex toys, some of them. I can say 
22 maybe three or four occasions that I saw in the sink, 
23 	
they were left out on the sink, and just 
24 	
Q. 	
Where would he keep these massagers? 
25 	
A. 	
When I was there, we keep all the stuff in

a basket inside Ms. Maxwell's closet. It was a big 
2 	
basket, about this round (indicating), with a cover on 
it. And we used to pick up from the towel and just dump 
4 	
it in there. That's it. That's the standard we went 
5 	
through. 
6 	
Q. 	
What sink would you find those massagers 
7 	
in? 
8 	
A. 	
Mostly in his sink, in his bathroom sink. 
9 	
Q. 	
His bathroom sink? 
10 	
Was Ms. Maxwell still his girlfriend at 
11 	
that time? 
12 	
A. 	
Oh, yeah. 
13 	
Q. 	
Still his girlfriend that you know of right 
14 	
now? 
15 	
A. 	
Yeah. We left, she was still his 
16 	
girlfriend. I don't know now, but she was still there. 
17 	
Q. 	
Why did you leave at the end? 
18 	
A. 	
It was a hard job. It was an incredible 
19 hard job. So demanding. Hours were terrible, from 
20 	
5 o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock at night. 
21 	
Constantly on your feet. 
22 	
I got very sick. My health went down the 
23 drain. I was diagnosed with cancer, polycythemia, a kind 
24 	
of blood cancer, and we had to leave. It was just too 
25 much for me.

Page 14 
Q. 	
Sounds like a lot. 
A. 	
Yeah. For me and my wife, we both left. 
3 	
Q. 	
It was very demanding when he was here in 
4 	
town? 
5 	
A. 	
It was terrible. Bad job. Pay was good, 
6 but we had enough. 
7 	
Q. 	
I know you guys had a falling out a couple 
8 	
of years ago; I guess you weren't working with him 
9 	
anymore. This would have been in 2003. You guys had a 
10 	
falling out, remember? 
11 	
A. 	
Yeah, we settled that. 
12 	
Q. 	
That was settled? 
13 	
A. 	
That was settled with him between us. 
14 	
Q. 	
Was that -- 
15 	
A. 	
It was an amicable -- it was an agreement, 
16 mutual agreement. It was a mistake on my part. 
17 	
Q. 	
Are there any questions you have of me? 
18 	
A. 	
No. I told you the truth. 
19 	
We just imagined things that could have 
20 happened. I used to talk to my wife all day, working and 
21 under that environment. But we didn't know for sure what 
22 was going on. 
23 	
We never heard anything. We never heard a 
24 	
complaint, or a girl crying. 
25 	
Q. 	
Would these massage girls, especially

1 towards the end, would they come alone or would they come 
2 	
with other people? 
3 	
A. 	
Mostly they would come alone. It was one 
	
4 	
girl, one of the young girls, the one I can't think of 
	
5 	
it, she would bring somebody else. She'd bring other 
	
6 	
girls. But I didn't even know the names. 
	
7 	
Q. 	
All of them would go downstairs? 
8 	
A. 	
Yes. 
9 	
Q. 	
Or would one stay downstairs? 
10 	
A. 	
Most of the times when that girl came, it 
11 was at night. So after dinner -- after dinner, they went 
12 to the movies. And by the time they went to the movies, 
13 we clean up right away and tried to get out of there. 
14 	
And that was about 8, 9 o'clock at night. 
15 	
After, when they come back, I don't know 
16 what happened. Our quarters were a different -- I don't 
17 	
know if you've been in the house, but our quarters were 
18 	
separate. 
19 	
Q. 	
It's separate. 
20 	
A. 	
Separate. Before -- that building is new. 
21 	
They build the building in 2001. 
22 	
Q. 	
The guest quarters? 
23 	
A. 	
Yeah, the guest quarters. 
24 	
Before, we had an apartment upstairs. 
25 	
Q 	
They have the laundry and a little office

and the bedroom? 
2 	
A. 	
Yes. That was 2001. Before that, we had 
3 	
an apartment upstairs in their house, in the main house. 
4 	
Q. 	
In the little rooms upstairs across from 
5 	
his master bedroom? 
6 	
A. 	
Right. 
7 	
Q. 	
Was there ever any photographs that you can 
8 	
recall around the house? 
9 	
A. 	
Girls, girls' photographs and guests' 
10 photographs, yes. 
11 	
Q. 	
Were they dressed or were they naked? 
12 	
A. 	
Most of them were dressed. It was a lot of 
13 entertainment in the pool, around the pool area. But 
14 	
most of them were dressed. 
15 	
Q. 	
When was the last time you spoke with 
16 	
Mr. Epstein? 
17 	
A. 	
The last time I spoke with Mr. Epstein was 
18 	
about a week ago, when you left me the card. I got 
19 scared because of that fallout that we had, and I thought 
20 	
it was a consequence of that. And I called and says, 
21 	
Jeffrey, what's going on, what's happening? Because I 
22 	
thought it was an investigation against me on his part. 
23 	
Q. 	
I'm sorry if I gave you that impression. 
24 	
A. 	
That's why I called him. That's the only 
25 	
reason that I called.

Q. 
Page 17 
Before I even spoke to you. 
Just when you found the card? 
3 
A. 
When I find the card, 	
I get scared. 	
I 
4 
said, 	
What's going on now? 	
Why are you bothering me now 
5 
in my house? 
6 
That's why I called him. 
He said, 	
John, 	
there is an investigation 
8 
going on. 	
I have nothing to talk to you. 	
That's it. 
9 
I said, 	
Okay. 
10 	
Q. 	
He didn't give you any information as to 
11 	
A. 	
No, not a word. 
12 	
Q. 	
Has anybody else contacted you from 
13 	
Mr. Epstein or his organization, his assistants, his 
14 	
attorney? 
15 	
A. 	
No, no, no. 
16 	
Q. 	
Anyone that works for his attorney? 
17 	
A. 	
For his attorney? Yes. For his attorney, 
18 	
the present attorney? Yes. That was an investigator 
19 	
that it was investigated on his side, I can't remember 
20 	
his name, but I understand it was from Roy Black's 
21 	
office. That was his attorney. And he -- this 
22 	
investigator basically asked me the same questions, 
23 	
exactly the same questions: What did I know, what did 
24 	
know. 
25 	
Q. 	
When did this happen?

1 	
A. 	
This happened about ten days ago -- about 
	
2 	
week ago, ten days ago. I'm not sure what date. 
	
3 	
Q. 	
Was his investigator's name -- 
4 	
A. 	
It's the date after I contacted you. 
7 	
Q. 	
-- Paul, first name Paul? 
6 	
A. 	
Paul, Paul, yes. 
7 	
You have the last name? 
8 	
Q. 	
No. 
9 	
A. 	
He asked me exactly the same questions. 
10 	
Q. 	
Did he offer you any money? 
11 	
A. 	
Absolutely not. I would not take it. 
12 	
Q. 	
Did he tell you not to speak to me? 
13 	
A. 	
No. 
He says -- no, he told me not to speak 
14 	
to you. He didn't say that to me. He says, It's your 
15 	
choice. You make that decision. 
16 	
And he says, If you hire a lawyer, you make 
17 	
that decision. 
18 	
And we feel that was important for us. 
19 	
don't want 	
to be involved with this thing. I'm out of 
20 the job three years ago, and that's why we hired 
21 	
Mr. Murrell. He suggested that. 
22 	
Q. 	
Did he ask you if anybody else has been 
23 	
contacted? 
24 	
A. 	
No. 
25 	
Q. 	
Did he tell you that to call him back after

our meeting? 
	
2 	
A. 	
No, no. 
3 	
Q. 	
Were you to have any contact with him at 
4 	
any time after our meeting? 
5 	
A. 	
If I will have a contact? I have no reason 
6 	
for it. I have no reason to call Jeffrey or anybody 
7 	
else. This is over, I hope. 
8 	
Q. 	
Well, Mr. Alessi, this is basically an 
9 	
ongoing investigation, so obviously anything that we 
10 discuss hopefully will stay between us. Because it is 
11 	
still ongoing, I wouldn't want this out until the 
12 	
investigation is complete. 
13 	
A. 	
It's not going anywhere. Even my kids 
14 	
don't know it. 
15 	
Q. 	
He contacted you after you called 
16 	
Mr. Epstein? 
17 	
A. 	
Yes. 
18 	
When I call him and I said, Jeffrey, what's 
19 going on? 
20 	
He said, John, I don't know what's going 
21 	
on. There's an investigation against me. 
22 	
So then I said, Whew, thank God. I don't 
23 	
know what's happening. 
24 	
And then he says, I have an investigator 
25 	
that is investigating, the same thing the police

1 	
department is doing. He's going to contact you. 
2 	
And that was the end of it. 
3 	
I think his name was Paul. I only met him 
4 	
for about fifteen minutes, ten minutes. 
5 	
Q. 	
You met at your house? 
6 	
A. 	
No, no. I don't want him at my house. We 
7 	
met at Carrabas restaurant, but it was not open, so we 
8 	
met outside Carrabas. It took about ten minutes. 
9 	
Q. 	
Going back to the items that were found in 
10 the sink, can you describe any of those massagers? 
11 	
A. 	
I only saw two things: It was a big, 
12 	
big 	
I think a vibrator. Big (indicating). And it was 
13 	
a long -- I hate to -- I'm sorry. It was a long dick, I 
14 	
think. Rubber thing. And there was a thing you used it 
15 	
in the back, the vibrator in the back. 
16 	
Q. 	
What color? 
17 	
A. 	
We always had those. Not those toys. 
18 	
Vibrators, we have different types, one for the neck, one 
19 for the back. You know the one that has a battery and 
20 	
they move, with balls on it, vibrator. That's it. 
21 	
That's what I find there. I never find anything else. 
22 Those two things. 
23 	
Q. 	
Do you remember any names of the girls that 
24 might have come over for massages? 
25 	
A. 	
Yes. I remember some of them. From the

1 beginning? From the end? 
2 	
Q. 	
As many as you can remember. 
3 	
A. 	
As many as I can remember. 
4 	
Q. 	
I know it's been a while. 
5 	
A. 	
It was Jody. It was Donna. And it was -- 
6 	
it was Virginia. It was -- how many? Virginia, Lana. 
7 	
It was also a young girl, but she was not a 
8 
massage therapist. She came to the house as a friend, 
9 	
think. I don't think she was a massage therapist. Her 
10 name was -- as a matter of fact, she's in a soap opera 
11 	
now, she's a star. Just give me a minute. 
12 	
Nadya Jorlin, J-O-R-L-I-N. 
13 	
There also were men masseuses. 
14 	
Q. 	
There were men too? 
15 	
A. 	
There were men. A few. Not that many. 
16 	
few. I can't remember. 
17 	
Allison. There was an Allison. There was 
18 	
a Dina. I think every name -- girls' names. In 
19 eleven years, I cannot remember. 
20 	
Q. 	
That's fine. 
21 	
A. 	
There were girls coming and going. There 
22 were girls traveling with him as massage therapists. 
23 They would travel with him all over the world, because he 
24 	
was in the plane, he got massages on the plane, 
25 because -- I know because I used to supply the oils and

the towels for the plane. 
	
2 	
Q. 	
Would you clean his plane too? 
3 	
A. 	
No, no. 
Q. 	
Did you ever travel with him anywhere? 
5 	
A. 	
No, no. 
6 	
Q. 	
When he went to New York or Arizona or his 
7 private island? 
8 	
A. 	
I've been on his island. I've been as a 
9 	
guest, as a vacation. We just took vacations, and I went 
10 	
to his island in the Caribbean. And I've been in New 
11 	
Mexico. I've been at his house in London. But not as a 
12 	
worker, just vacation. 
13 	
Q. 	
As a vacation? 
14 	
A. 	
Uh-huh. 
15 	
We went to New Mexico for -- it was kind of 
16 a symposium about how to clean homes. It was this lady 
17 who make -- teach all the house people, housemen, and 
18 they invited us to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to teach us how 
19 to clean homes. That was kind of stupid. 
20 	
Q. 	
How he wanted it to be cleaned? 
21 	
A. 	
Yes. We didn't get that much. 
22 	
Q. 	
Can you think of anything that I haven't 
23 asked you that might be relevant to this? 
24 	
A. 	
I can't think of anything. Basically it's 
25 the same questions that the other investigator asked me.

1 	
Exactly the same. 
	
2 	
I wish I could give you more names. 
3 Allison -- 
4 	
Q. 	
I'm not going to ask you to do that because 
5 	
I know it's been a long time. I can't think of stuff 
6 	
did last week. 
7 	
A. 	
It's been a long time. 
8 	
Q. 	
If by any chance you are contacted again by 
9 his investigator again for any more questions or anything 
10 or any packages that he may deliver to you 
11 	
A. 	
They have to go to Mr. Murrell. 
12 	
Q. 	
I was going to say, have him contact your 
13 	
attorney. 
14 	
MR. MURRELL: Packages? Are we expecting a 
15 	
delivery of something? 
16 	
DET. RECAREY: No. I'm just saying -- 
17 	
MR. MURRELL: Okay. Just making sure there 
18 	
wasn't something I didn't know about. 
19 	
DET. RECAREY: I.e., gifts, et cetera. 
20 	
That kind of thing. 
21 	
THE WITNESS: No. 
22 	
DET. RECAREY: I would appreciate a phone 
23 	
call just to give me a heads up. 
24 	
THE WITNESS: I do not intend to contact 
25 	
him at all.
