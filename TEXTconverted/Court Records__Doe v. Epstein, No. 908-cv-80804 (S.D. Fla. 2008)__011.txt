SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
 
CASE NO.:  08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
 
JANE DOE, a/k/a, 
JANE DOE NO. 1, 
 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
vs. 
 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY 
ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, 
 
 
Defendants. 
________________________________/ 
 
MOTION TO REMAND 
 
 
Plaintiff Jane Doe moves the Court to remand this action to state court for lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction and states as follows: 
1. Although Plaintiff Jane Doe, a Florida citizen, sues Haley Robson, also a Florida 
citizen, in this action, Defendants removed the case to federal court on July 21, 
2008, citing diversity of citizenship as the basis for federal subject matter 
jurisdiction.   
2. Defendants claim that Haley Robson, who has described herself as Heidi Fleiss 
(the Hollywood madam),1 has “nothing to do with the plaintiff’s case against Mr. 
                                                 
1 See New York Post, Oct. 1, 2007 (reporting “Some of the girls, legal documents indicate, 
were recruited by Haley Robson, now 21, who described herself as ‘like Heidi Fleiss,’ the 
notorious Hollywood madam.”); Palm Beach Post, Aug. 14, 2006 (reporting that 
Defendant “Robson told detectives, ‘I'm like a Heidi Fleiss.’”).  
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 1 of 11

Epstein,” (Notice of Removal, DE 1, p. 3) and that Plaintiff fraudulently joined 
her in this action to prevent complete diversity.2 
3.  As demonstrated in Plaintiff’s amended complaint, however, Defendant Robson 
was a vital part of the scheme to lure underage girls, including Plaintiff, to 
Epstein’s home in order to subject them to sexual abuse and induce them to 
engage in lewd behavior.  Defendant Robson was a key player in this scheme 
because she was paid by Epstein to recruit the underage girls and take them to 
Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion.  (Amended Complaint ¶¶ 11-15, DE 1, pp. 302-
04).  Without Defendant Robson, these girls, including Plaintiff, would not have 
been victimized.   
4. Because the allegations in Plaintiff’s amended complaint support the causes of 
action against Defendant Robson for civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of 
emotional distress, and civil RICO, Robson is a proper defendant in this action.   
5. As Robson is admittedly a citizen of Florida, (Affidavit of Haley Robson, DE 1, 
pp. 230-31) as is Plaintiff Jane Doe,3 (Amended Complaint ¶ 1, DE 1, pp. 301; 
Deposition of Jane Doe, DE 1, pp. 31-32, 5:14-18, 6:6-10) federal diversity 
jurisdiction does not exist in this case.  See 28 U.S.C. §1332(a)(1) (providing that 
                                                 
2 Defendants also argue that Plaintiff named Robson as a defendant to prevent entry of a 
stay in this matter pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k).  The Court has since denied 
Defendants’ motion, holding a stay of this proceeding is not warranted under either the 
statute or the Court’s discretion.  (Order Denying Motion to Stay, DE 7).   
3 Although Jane Does testified in deposition that she is a citizen of Florida, Defendants 
question whether she might actually be a citizen of Georgia because her mother lives in 
Georgia.  (Notice of Removal, DE 1, pp. 7-8, n.6).  Defendants fail to point out, however, 
that there is a question of whether Defendant Epstein is actually a citizen of Florida 
because he is now incarcerated in a Florida jail under an eighteen month sentence, to be 
followed by twelve months of community control, during which Epstein agreed he will 
be residing in Palm Beach, Florida.  (Epstein Sentence, attached).   
 
2
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 2 of 11

district courts have original jurisdiction over cases in which the matter in 
controversy exceeds $75,000 and is between “citizens of different States”).     
6. Defendants’ removal of this action was, therefore, improper.  Because the Court 
lacks diversity jurisdiction, or any other form of subject matter jurisdiction, over 
this matter, the Court must remand this action to Florida state court.   
 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests the Court remand this action to state court and 
requests Defendants be ordered under 28 U.S.C. §1447(c) to pay costs and attorney fees 
incurred as a result of the removal. 
 
MEMORANDUM OF LEGAL AUTHORITY 
 
“An action in state court may be removed to federal court when the federal courts 
have diversity or federal question jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). When a 
defendant removes a case to federal court on diversity grounds, a court must remand the 
matter back to state court if any of the properly joined parties in interest are citizens of 
the state in which the suit was filed. See Lincoln Prop. Co. v. Roche, 546 U.S. 81, 126 
S.Ct. 606, 613, 163 L.Ed.2d 415 (2005) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1441(b)). Such a remand is 
the necessary corollary of a federal district court's diversity jurisdiction, which requires 
complete diversity of citizenship.”  Henderson v. Washington Nat. Ins. Co., 454 F.3d 
1278, 1281 (11th Cir. 2006).   
Federal Courts are obligated to construe removal statutes very strictly, and “all 
doubts about jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of remand to state court.” Univ. of 
South Alabama v. American Tobacco Co., 168 F.3d 405, 411 (11th Cir. 1999) (citing 
Burns v. Windsor Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 1092, 1095 (11th Cir. 1994), and Coker v. Amoco Oil 
 
3
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 3 of 11

Co., 709 F.2d 1433 (11th Cir. 1983)).  “A presumption in favor of remand is necessary 
because if a federal court reaches the merits of a pending motion in a removed case where 
subject matter jurisdiction may be lacking it deprives a state court of its right under the 
Constitution to resolve controversies in its own courts.”  American Tobacco Co., 168 
F.3d at 411.   
Defendants have removed this action even though Plaintiff named Haley Robson, 
a citizen of Florida, as a defendant because they claim Plaintiff’s joinder of Defendant 
Robson was done fraudulently in order to avoid federal jurisdiction.  “In a removal case 
alleging fraudulent joinder, the removing party has the burden of proving that either: (1) 
there is no possibility the plaintiff can establish a cause of action against the resident 
defendant; or (2) the plaintiff has fraudulently pled jurisdictional facts to bring the 
resident defendant into state court.”  Crowe v. Coleman, 113 F.3d 1536, 1538 (11th Cir. 
1989) (citing Cabalceta v. Standard Fruit Co., 883 F.2d 1553, 1561 (11th Cir. 1989)). 
“The burden of the removing party is a ‘heavy one.’”  Id. (quoting B., Inc. v. Miller 
Brewing Co., 663 F.2d 545, 549 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981)). 
“To determine whether the case should be remanded, the district court must 
evaluate the factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and must 
resolve any uncertainties about state substantive law in favor of the plaintiff.”  Id. (citing 
B., Inc., 663 F.2d at 549).  The Court may not “weigh the merits of a plaintiff's claim 
beyond determining whether it is an arguable one under state law.”  Id.  “‘If there is even 
a possibility that a state court would find that the complaint states a cause of action 
against any one of the resident defendants, the federal court must find that joinder was 
proper and remand the case to state court.’”  Id. (quoting Coker v. Amoco Oil Co., 709 
 
4
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 4 of 11

F.2d 1433, 1440-41 (11th Cir. 1983)).  This protects a plaintiff’s right to select the forum 
of his lawsuit and the manner in which to prosecute the suit, and avoids exposing the 
plaintiff to the possibility of prosecuting the suit to conclusion only to learn the federal 
court lacked jurisdiction on removal.  Id. (citing Parks v. The New York Times Co., 308 
F.2d 474, 478 (5th Cir.1962); Cowart Iron Works, Inc. v. Phillips Constr. Co., Inc., 507 
F.Supp. 740, 744 (S.D. Ga. 1981)).        
Here, Defendants argue that removal is proper because Plaintiff cannot state a 
cause of action against Defendant Robson under Florida law.  Viewing the allegations of 
the amended complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, it is clear that there is at 
least a possibility that Plaintiff can recover against Defendant Robson under Florida law 
for each of the counts in the amended complaint—civil conspiracy, intentional infliction 
of emotional distress, and civil RICO.  Joinder of Defendant Robson in this action was 
therefore proper, which requires remand of this action to Florida state court.   
 
a. 
Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for civil conspiracy against 
Defendant Robson . 
 
“The elements of a civil conspiracy are: (a) a conspiracy between two or more 
parties, (b) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means, (c) the doing of 
some overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy, and (d) damage to plaintiff as a result of 
the acts performed pursuant to the conspiracy.”  Walters v. Blankenship, 931 So. 2d 137, 
140 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006) (citing Florida Fern Growers Ass'n, Inc. v. Concerned Citizens 
of Putnam County, 616 So. 2d 562 (Fla. 5th DCA 1993)).  As Defendants point out, there 
muse be an “actionable underlying tort or wrong” for an actionable conspiracy claim.  
Wright v. Yurko, 446 So. 2d 1162, 1165 (Fla. 5th DCA 1984).   
 
5
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 5 of 11

Plaintiff has grounded her conspiracy claim on the tort of sexual assault alleged in 
Count I of her amended complaint.  In this count, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Epstein 
tortiously assaulted her and states that the assault was committed in violation of Chapter 
800 of the Florida Statutes.  (Amended Complaint ¶¶ 17-18, DE 1, pp. 304-05).  Under 
Florida law, sexual assault is an intentional tort.  See Doe v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., 394 
F.3d 891, 917 (11th Cir. 2004) (“Florida law equates sexual battery with an intentional 
tort.”).  This is true regardless of whether Defendant Epstein’s violation of Chapter 800 
of the Florida Statutes also creates a private right of action, which is a matter of first 
impression in Florida.  Thus, Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for civil 
conspiracy against Defendant Robson.   
 
b. 
Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for intentional infliction of 
emotional distress against Defendant Robson. 
 
 “The elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) 
The wrongdoer's conduct was intentional or reckless, that is, he intended his behavior 
when he knew or should have known that emotional distress would likely result; (2) the 
conduct was outrageous, that is, as to go beyond all bounds of decency, and to be 
regarded as odious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the conduct 
caused emotion[al] distress; and (4) the emotional distress was severe.”  Gallogly v. 
Rodriguez, 970 So. 2d 470, 471 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007) (citing LeGrande v. Emmanuel, 889 
So. 2d 991, 994-95 (Fla. 3d DCA 2004)).   
Here, Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant Robson used false pretenses to lure her 
(a 14-year old girl) to the mansion of Defendant Epstein and physically took her to 
Epstein so that he could subject her to sexual abuse and lewd behavior.  Defendant 
 
6
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 6 of 11

Robson recruited Plaintiff, as she had done numerous others, under the belief that 
Plaintiff was economically disadvantaged and would be unlikely to contact authorities 
after being sexually assaulted and abused by Defendant Epstein.  Defendant Robson was 
paid by Defendant Epstein only after the sexual assault and abuse were completed.  And, 
Defendant Robson knew that Plaintiff would be severely emotionally traumatized after 
the abuse.  (Amended Complaint ¶¶ 9, 11, 15, 24-28, DE 1, pp. 302-03, 304, 306).  These 
allegations are enough to demonstrate Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for 
intentional infliction of emotional distress against Defendant Robson because they 
amount to conduct that would be viewed as outrageous by any reasonable person.        
Defendants argue that Plaintiff is barred from recovering for intentional infliction 
of emotional distress under Florida law because she went to Defendant Epstein’s home 
with the intent to give him a massage for monetary compensation when it is a crime (a 
misdemeanor), under section 480.047, Florida Statutes, to practice massage without a 
license.  They claim Plaintiff cannot “recover damages flowing from her own illegal 
conduct.”  (Notice of Removal, DE 1, p. 16).   
First, Plaintiff’s damages do not flow from her conduct in giving Defendant 
Epstein a massage without a license.  Defendants Epstein, Kellen, and Robson engaged in 
a scheme to lure underage girls to Epstein’s mansion in order for Epstein to sexually 
abuse them.  Plaintiff’s damages resulting from Defendants making her a victim to their 
intentional, outrageous, and criminal conduct in no way flow from her decision as a 14-
year old girl to make some extra money by giving a massage.   
Furthermore, it is not a universal rule in Florida that any Plaintiff engaged in any 
criminal action, no matter how trivial, is barred from recovering damages suffered in 
 
7
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 7 of 11

connection with that conduct.  “The defense of in pari delicto is not woodenly applied in 
every case where illegality appears somewhere in the transaction; since the principle is 
founded on public policy, it may give way to a supervening public policy.”  Kulla v. E.F. 
Hutton & Co., Inc., 426 So. 2d 1055, 1057 n. 1 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983).  “‘The fundamental 
purpose of the rule must always be kept in mind, and the realities of the situation must be 
considered. Where, by applying the rule, the public cannot be protected because the 
transaction has been completed, where no serious moral turpitude is involved, where the 
defendant is the one guilty of the greatest moral fault, and where to apply the rule will be 
to permit the defendant to be unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff, the rule 
should not be applied.’”  Id.  (quoting Goldberg v. Sanglier, 96 Wash.2d 874, 639 P.2d 
1347, 1353-54 (1982)).  The fact that Florida law gives the trial court the discretion to 
apply the doctrine of in pari delicto, considering that all ambiguities must be resolved in 
favor of Plaintiff, does not take away from the fact that Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of 
action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against Defendant Robson.   
 
c. 
Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for civil RICO against Defendant 
Robson. 
 
Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiff does not have a cognizable cause of action 
for civil RICO under section 772.104, Florida Statutes, because she was not directly 
injured by the Defendants’ scheme.  In Count IV of the amended complaint, Plaintiff 
alleges that Defendants engaged in a pattern of criminal activity in which Defendant 
Robson found and delivered underage girls to Defendant Epstein in order for Epstein to 
“solicit, induce, coerce, entice, compel or force such girls to engage in acts of prostitution 
and/or lewdness.”  (Amended Complaint ¶ 32, DE 1, p. 307).  She also alleges that she 
 
8
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 8 of 11

was a victim of Defendants’ scheme because she was one of the underage girls found and 
delivered to Defendant Epstein by Defendant Robson and that she endured Epstein’s 
actions as he tried to get her to engage in, and forced upon her, acts of prostitution and 
lewdness.  (Amended Complaint ¶ 33, DE 1, pp. 307-308).  Plaintiff, who was a victim of 
Defendants’ scheme, was directly harmed by the scheme and it is damages for this harm 
that she seeks in Count IV of the amended complaint.  Cf. Palmas Y Bambu, S.A. v. E.I. 
Dupont De Nemours & Co., Inc., 881 So. 2d 565, 570 (Fla. 3d DCA 2004) (holding 
plaintiff has standing to sue for civil RICO when her injuries flow directly from 
commission of the predicate acts, which means “when the alleged predicate act is mail or 
wire fraud, the plaintiff must have been a target of the scheme to defraud and must have 
relied to his detriment on misrepresentations made in furtherance of that scheme”).  
Because Plaintiff was a target of Defendants’ scheme and was harmed by their actions in 
carrying out the scheme, Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for civil RICO against 
Defendant Robson.      
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff has cognizable causes of against Defendant Robson, a Florida citizen, for 
civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil RICO.  Because 
Plaintiff has a possibility of recovering against Defendant Robson under her amended 
complaint, Defendants have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that Robson was 
fraudulently joined in this action.  As the parties lack complete diversity of citizenship, 
the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this matter and should remand this case to 
Florida state court.
