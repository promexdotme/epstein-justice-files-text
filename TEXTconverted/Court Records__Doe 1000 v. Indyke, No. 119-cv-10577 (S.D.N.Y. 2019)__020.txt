SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE DOE 1000, 
Plaintiff,  
                        v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
in their capacities as the executors of the 
ESTATE OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN, 
Defendants.
     Case No. 1:19-cv-10577-LGS-KNF
ORDER ON PLAINTIFF’S ANONYMITY 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that any person subject to this Order, including the parties to 
this action and their respective counsel of record, shall adhere to the following terms: 
1. Within three (3) days of entry of this Order, Counsel of Record for Plaintiff shall disclose 
Plaintiff’s identity to Counsel of Record for Defendants, in writing.  
2. Counsel of Record for Defendants may disclose Plaintiff’s identity only to Defendants and 
any attorneys, paralegals, and clerical or other assistants working with or for Defendants 
on matters related to this action; and the recipients of such information shall not disclose it 
to any other persons.   
3. If Defendants wish to disclose Plaintiff’s identity to any person not otherwise permitted to 
receive such information under this Order, Defendants are limited to doing so in connection 
with defending this action, and must require such person to first execute a non-disclosure 
agreement, in a form agreed to by the parties, that prevents such person from disclosing 
Plaintiff’s identity to any other persons.  Defendants must maintain a list of all such persons 
to whom Plaintiff’s identity is disclosed and copies of the executed non-disclosure 
agreements, all of which are subject to in camera inspection.  
4. All portions of pleadings, motions or other papers filed with the Court that disclose 
Plaintiff’s identity shall be filed under seal with the Clerk of the Court and kept under seal 
until further order of the Court.  The parties shall use their best efforts to minimize such 
sealing.  Any party filing a motion or any other papers with the Court under seal shall also 
publicly file a redacted copy of the same, via the Court’s Electronic Case Filing system, 
that redacts the Plaintiff’s identity and text that would reveal Plaintiff’s identity. 
5. The parties may seek to modify or amend this Order at any time upon motion to the Court 
or by stipulation.
