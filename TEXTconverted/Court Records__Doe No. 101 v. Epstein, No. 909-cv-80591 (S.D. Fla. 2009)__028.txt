MOTION FOR AN ORDER FOR THE PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE 
AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
3 

Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 4 of 15
Plaintiffs, Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 (the "Plaintiffs"), pursuant to Rules 
26, 34, and 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, hereby move this Court for an Order for 
the Preservation of Evidence directed to Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, and, as grounds, state as 
follows: 
I. 
After investigations by the Palm Beach Police Department ("PBPD"), the Palm 
Beach State Attorney's Office ("PB SAO"), the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), and the 
United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida ("USAO"), Defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, in June 2008, entered pleas of "guilty" in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in Palm 
Beach County, Florida, to various Florida state crimes involving the solicitation of minors for 
prostitution and the procurement of minors for the purposes of prostitution. 
2. 
As outlined in detail in the relevant complaints, beginning in or around 1998 
through in or around September 2007, Defendant used his resources and his influence over 
vulnerable minor children to engage in a systematic pattern of sexually exploitative behavior. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, sexually abused Plaintiffs while Plaintiffs were under the age of 18 
years old. 
3. 
As a result of Defendant's sexual abuse, Plaintiffs filed their actions, alleging 
multiple violations of federal statutes condemning the coercion and enticement of a minor to 
engage in prostitution or sexual activity, travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, sex 
trafficking of children, sexual exploitation of minor children, transport of visual depictions of a 
minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, transport of child pornography, child exploitation 
enterprises, and other crimes, specifically including, but not limited to, those crimes designated 
in 18 U.S.C. § 2421, § 2422(a), § 2422(b), § 2423(a), § 2423(b), § 2423(e), § 2251, § 2252, § 
2252A(a)(l), and§ 2252A(g)(l). 
4 

Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 5 of 15
4. 
On October 25, 2005, the PBPD executed a search warrant at Defendant's Palm 
Beach, Florida mansion at 358 El Brillo Way. Thus, Defendant reasonably should have known 
of potential criminal prosecution and/or civil litigation since at least that date. 
5. 
According to the PBPD Property Receipt, evidence seized during the October 25, 
2005 search included phone message books, photographs of nude underage females, VHS tapes, 
CDs, and school transcripts of underage girls. See PBPD Property Receipt (attached hereto as 
Exhibit A). While still incarcerated, Defendant filed a Motion for Return of Property with the 
Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County on July 23, 2008. 
On September 5, 2008, this Court entered an Order in Jane Doe v. Jeffrey Epstein, et al., Case 
No. 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON, directing Defendant to preserve the evidence listed in 
the PBPD Property Receipt and to provide duplicates to the plaintiff should this evidence be 
returned to Defendant by the State of Florida (DE# 20). 
6. 
According to the PBPD Property Receipt, at least some of the evidence has 
already been returned to Defendant, including zip CDs, 8mm videotapes, floppy disks, zip drive 
disks, CPUs from various areas throughout the mansion, and phone message books. Upon 
information and belief, one or more sexually explicit printed photographs of Plaintiffs and other 
minor girls taken by Defendant and/or his agents when Plaintiffs were minors were confiscated 
during the search and may have been returned to him. In addition, the zip CDs, 8mm videotapes, 
floppy disks, zip drive disks, and CPUs that were returned to Defendant may have contained, and 
may still contain, pornographic images of these and other minors. Plaintiffs respectfully request 
that this Court clarify that the Order of September 5, 2008 requires returned evidence to be 
preserved. 
7. 
In addition, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to take judicial notice that, in 
the event that such evidence includes child pornography, it is imperative for the PBPD, the FBI, 
5 

Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 6 of 15
the USAO, and the PBSAO not to return any photographs that may be child pornography 
(including files, electronic or otherwise) to Defendant or his counsel. Pursuant to the Adam 
Walsh Protection and Safety Act, Pub. L. No. 109-248, 120 Stat. 587 (2006), any property or 
material that constitutes child pornography shall remain in the care, custody, and control of either 
the government or the court. Defendant has no right to seek its return. See 18 U.S.C. § 3509(m) 
(2008). In addition, copying evidence that constitutes child pornography is not permissible as 
long as the Government makes the property or material reasonably available to the defendant. 
See 18 U.S.C. § 3509(m)(2)(A) (2008). 
8. 
In addition to evidence related to the October 25 search, Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, exercises sole custody and control over specific evidence relevant and material to this 
lawsuit relating to Defendant's sexual abuse of Plaintiffs, including, but not limited to, 
documents, data, and tangible things, including, but not limited to, writings; records; files; 
correspondence; digital or chemical process photographs (including negatives); reports; 
memoranda; calendars; diaries; minutes; electronic messages; voicemail; e-mail; telephone 
message records or logs; computer and network activity logs; hard drives; backup data; 
removable computer storage media, such as tapes, disks, and cards; printouts; document image 
files; web pages; databases; spreadsheets; software; books; ledgers; journals; orders; invoices; 
bills; vouchers; checks; statements; worksheets; summaries; compilations; computations; charts; 
diagrams; graphic presentations; drawings; films; charts; video, phonographic, tape, or digital 
recordings or transcripts thereof; drafts; jottings; and notes. Information that serves to identify, 
locate, or link such material, such as file inventories, file folders, indices, and metadata, is also 
included. Specifically, Plaintiffs consider the following evidence relevant: records of phone 
communications; records of domestic and international travel, including travel in Defendant's 
private airplanes; former and current employee records; tax returns; medical bills; bills regarding 
6 

Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 7 of 15
any other expenses; all documents evidencing payment by Defendant of U.S. currency and/or 
merchandise to each victim; any evidence stored in Defendant's storage unit; photographs of 
Defendant's mansions; any diary, log, memo pad, calendar, or other writing reflecting date of 
each victim's visit(s) to Defendant's mansions; any diary or document wherein each victim 
wrote regarding a victim's visit to Defendant's mansions; all documents sent to or by the PBPD, 
the FBI, the USAO, or the PBSAO; and all computers used by Defendant and/or his agents 
and/or employees since 1998. 
9. 
Other relevant evidence includes, but is not limited to, electronically-stored 
information stored on Defendant's current and former computer systems and other media and 
devices (including handheld devices, personal digital assistants, voice-messaging systems, online 
repositories, and cellular telephones). Electronically-stored information should be afforded the 
broadest possible meaning and includes ( by way of example and not as an exclusive list) 
potentially relevant information electronically, magnetically, optically, or otherwise stored as: 
I. 
Digital communication (e.g., e-mail, voice mail, instant messaging); 
2. 
E-mail Server Stores (e.g., Lotus Domino .NSF and Microsoft Exchange .EDB) 
3. 
Word-processed documents (e.g., Word and WordPerfect files and drafts); 
4. 
Spreadsheets and tables (e.g., Excel or Lotus 123 worksheets); 
5. 
Accounting Application Data (e.g., QuickBooks, Money, Peachtree data); 
6. 
Image and Facsimile Files (e.g., .PDF, .TIFF, .JPG, .GIF images); 
7. 
Sound Recordings (e.g., .W AV and .MP3 files); 
8. 
Video and Animation (e.g., .AV! and .MOV files); 
9. 
Databases (e.g., Access, Oracle, SQL Server data, SAP); 
10. 
Contact and Relationship Management Data (e.g., Outlook, ACTI); 
11. 
Calendar and Diary Application Data (e.g., Outlook PST, blog entries); 
12. 
Online Access Data (e.g., Temporary Internet Files, History, Cookies); 
13. 
Presentations (e.g., PowerPoint, Corel Presentations); 
14. 
Network Access and Server Activity Logs; 
15. 
Project Management Application Data; 
16. 
Computer Aided Design/Drawing Files; and 
17. 
Backup and archival files (e.g., Veritas, Zip, .GHO). 
7 

Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 8 of 15
10. 
Plaintiffs also respectfully request this Court to order Defendant to preserve all 
potentially relevant evidence, even if Defendant does not intend to produce such evidence 
because he anticipates raising his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. 
11. 
As more fully set forth in Plaintiff Jane Doe No. 102's Complaint (DE# 1 in Case 
No.: 09-CV-80656-MARRA/JOHNSON), Defendant is a designated sexual offender who 
sexually exploited minor girls all over the world, including in some or all of his six mansions. 
Thus, there is reason to believe that relevant evidence, including many photographs of other nude 
underage females, exists in some or all of Defendant's six mansions, with all but one of his 
mansions located outside the State of Florida. 
12. 
On May 15, 2009, Plaintiffs counsel sent a letter to Defendant's counsel detailing 
the numerous sources of relevant evidence in this matter (the "Preservation Letter," attached 
hereto as Exhibit B). Despite requests for a written response confirming Defendant's duty to 
take the necessary steps to preserve all relevant evidence, Defendant and his counsel have neither 
acknowledged this letter nor confirmed their duty to preserve all relevant evidence under the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
13. 
In the past, Defendant's counsel have asserted that a motion requesting to 
preserve evidence would be moot because of an order previously entered in Jane Doe v. Jeffrey 
Epstein, et al., Case No. 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON. Plaintiffs respectfully submit that 
an enforceable order is needed in their particular cases and that the binding order needs to cover 
evidence other than evidence related to the October 25, 2005 search of Defendant's Palm Beach 
mansion. The sole focus of the previous order is seized evidence identified in the PBPD 
Property Receipt. 
There is great need to preserve all evidence (physical and electronic), 
especially with respect to potential evidence related to Defendant's possession, production, 
and/or transportation of child pornography. In addition, there is reason to believe that relevant 
8 

Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 9 of 15
evidence, including many photographs of other nude mmor girls, exist in some or all of 
Defendant's six mansions and/or on some or all of his computers. Given Defendant's efforts to 
gain control over evidence in the custody of the PBPD, as well as Defendant's unwillingness to 
acknowledge or respond to Plaintiffs Preservation Letter, a legitimate concern remains for the 
continuing existence and maintenance of the integrity of the evidence in question absent an order 
preserving the evidence. This evidence, some of which is in the sole custody, dominion, and 
control of Defendant, is critical and indispensable to Plaintiffs' cases. 
Memorandum of Law 
When there is a good faith belief that evidence may be lost, the Court has the authority to 
enter an order preserving such evidence. See AT & T Mobility LLC v. Dynamic Cellular Corp., 
No. 08-20537-Civ., 2008 WL 2139518, at *2 (S.D. Fla. May 7, 2008); see also Trac/one 
Wireless. Inc. v. King Trading, Inc., No. 3-08-CV-0398-B, 2008 WL 918243, at *1 (N.D. Tex. 
Mar. 13, 2008) (finding "a legitimate concern for the continuing existence and maintenance of 
the integrity of the evidence in question absent an order preserving the evidence"). This 
evidence, some of which is in the sole custody, dominion, and control of Defendant, is critical 
and indispensable to Plaintiffs' cases. The evidence that Plaintiffs seek to protect is relevant and 
critical to the prosecution not only of their actions, but for the prosecution of at least ten other 
filed actions against Defendant and twenty-two other as-yet-unfiled actions by Defendant's 
victims listed on the USAO List. Plaintiffs' concerns outweigh any harm to Defendant that may 
result from a preservation order. Given Defendant's vast wealth and demonstrated willingness to 
incur expenses, Defendant will not be unduly burdened by such an order. See Trac/one Wireless, 
Inc., 2008 WL 918243, at *I. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is a designated sexual offender who was convicted of 
violating various Florida state crimes involving the solicitation of minors for prostitution and the 
9 

Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 10 of 15
procurement of minors for the purposes of prostitution, and is currently serving his sentence 
based on the charges that form the foundation of Plaintiffs' claims. Therefore, it is reasonable to 
assume that both the evidence seized by the PBPD and other relevant evidence in Defendant's 
custody and control is extremely harmful to Defendant's position in his civil cases. Defendant's 
successful efforts to obtain the return of some of the seized property causes Plaintiffs grave 
concern regarding his willingness to comply with his duty to preserve all evidence relevant to 
Plaintiffs' actions. Without a protective order, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, may seek to destroy 
records and information to thwart this lawsuit and many other lawsuits and thus perpetuate the 
wrongs that the federal laws regarding the sexual exploitation of children intend to protect. 
Because of the nature of the relevant violations, which include allegations of production 
and transportation of child pornography, electronically-stored information is a valuable and 
irreplaceable source of discovery and/or evidence in these matters. Plaintiffs anticipate that 
much of the information subject to disclosure or responsive to discovery in this cause is stored on 
Defendant's former computer systems and other media and devices. In addition, as previously 
stated, Plaintiffs believe that crucial relevant evidence may be present in some or all of the 
computers in perhaps each of his six mansions (in Palm Beach, New York City, Santa Fe, 
London, Paris, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). 
Finally, in the other pending Jane Doe cases with active discovery, Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, has objected to the production of any evidence on Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth 
Amendment grounds. Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 challenge Defendant's 
objections to discovery and, more relevant to the matter at hand, request that this Court issue an 
order clearly stating that Defendant has a duty to preserve all relevant evidence, regardless of 
whether he intends to raise his privilege against self-incrimination. See Capricorn Power Co. v. 
Siemens Westinghouse Power Corp., 220 F.R.D. 429, 434 (W.D. Pa. 2004) (A motion for a 
10 

Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 11 of 15
preservation order can be granted with regard to all items of evidence that are discoverable in 
accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, without the necessity of establishing that 
the evidence will necessarily be relevant and admissible at trial.) 
WHEREFORE, in light of the above-stated duty to preserve all relevant evidence, 
Plaintiffs, Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102, move this Court to enter an Order granting 
Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102's Motion for the Preservation of Evidence. 
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RULE 7.1.A.3 
Undersigned counsel conferred with counsel for Defendant in a good faith effort to 
resolve the issues raised in this motion. Despite requests for a written response acknowledging 
Defendant's duty to take the necessary steps to preserve all relevant evidence to alleviate the 
need for this motion, Defendant's counsel have failed to respond or acknowledge in any way 
Defendant's duty to preserve all relevant evidence under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
