Re: 
Davies v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10788 (GHW)(DCF) 
 
Your Honor: 
 
 
 
We represent Plaintiff Teala Davies.  With the consent of all parties, 
we write respectfully to request a one-week extension of the briefing deadlines for 
the Defendants’ pending motion to dismiss (ECF 26).   
 
 
Plaintiff’s opposition papers are currently due on March 20 and 
Defendants’ reply papers are currently due on March 30.  We request a one-week 
extension of both of those deadlines, so that Plaintiff’s opposition papers would be 
due on March 27 and Defendants’ reply papers would be due on April 7.  This 
extension of time is needed due to challenges arising from COVID-19 response 
measures, including school and office closures.   
 
We have conferred with Bennet J. Moskowitz, counsel for Defendants, 
and he consents to this extension.  This extension would not affect any other 
deadlines in this case.  No previous extension of time has been requested since Your 
Honor entered the parties’ proposed briefing schedule on February 28, 2020 (ECF 
25).   
   
 
 
We appreciate Your Honor’s attention to this matter. 
 
  
 
Very truly yours, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 /s/ Mariann Meier Wang
