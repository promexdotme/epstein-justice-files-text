PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S PROTECTIVE RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION 
FOR RECONSIDERATION AND/OR REQUEST FOR RULE 4 REVIEW AND APPEAL 
 
 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe, hereby files this protective response to Defendant’s 
Consolidated Rule 4 Review and Appeal of Portions of the Magistrate’s Orders Dated 
February 4, 2010 (DE 462), (DE 480) and April 1, 2010 (DE 513), with Incorporated 
Objections and Memorandum of Law (doc. #454).   
 
Jane Doe had understood that she had fully briefed the issues raised by the 
defendant’s pleading when on March10, 2010, she filed her response in Opposition to 
Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration (doc. #485).   It appears, however, the 
defendant Epstein may view his “consolidated” appeal as requiring some sort of new 
response from Jane Doe.  If so, Jane Doe wishes to make clear that she continues to

assert the responses she raised in her earlier response and hereby files this protective 
response incorporating by reference all of her earlier arguments. 
 
Jane Doe would also note she filed her request for these documents on July 20, 
2009.  Through a seemingly endless series of motions, all of which have been rejected 
on the merits, Epstein has blocked turning over tax returns and other documents that 
the Government has already seen on Fifth Amendment grounds for more than ten 
months.  Jane Doe’s trial date is less than two months away on July 19, 2010, and she 
needs the requested items soon to prepare for trial.   
 
Jane Doe attempted to negotiate a resolution to these issues with counsel for 
Epstein, but the negotiations failed. 
 
Jane Doe therefore respectfully requests that the Court promptly order 
production of these documents to her.
