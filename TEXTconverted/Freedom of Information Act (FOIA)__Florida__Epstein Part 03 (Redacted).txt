Q. 
Yeah. 
Your wife said the same number you did. 
558? 358? 558? 
It was 358. 
We left three years ago. 
And I understand it's been some time since 
7 	
then. So the questions I'm going to ask you basically 
8 	
is: During your time, did you deal directly with 
9 	
Mr. Epstein? 
10 	
A. 	
Yes. And her -- and her -- girlfriend, 
11 	
manager. She was the manager of all the households, 
12 	
because he has homes all over the world. 
13 	
Q. 	
Right. 
14 	
A. 	
So we have -- she was my boss, and I deal 
15 	
directly with her. 
16 	
Q. 	
Who was --

A. 	
Elaine Maxwell.

A. 	
Um-hum.

A. 	
Yes. Many, many, many guests. It was 
2 	
never with no guests. 
3 	
Q. 	
Did he have assistants with him? 
4 	
A. 	
Assistants? At the last year he had an 
5 	
assistant just for him. They would travel with him all 
6 	
the time. At the last -- in the last two years of my 
7 	
stay there, he also have a chef, a gourmet chef that he 
8 	
would travel with him. That's it. 
9 	
Q. 	
Do you remember the chef's name? 
10 	
A. 	
There were quite a few. The last one I 
11 	
know is Adam Perry. P-E-R-R-Y, I think. And he was from 
12 	
New York. 
13 	
And there was another French chef, Didier 
14 	
(phonetic); I don't know his last name. 
15 	
And there was another English chef. But 
16 	
they went quickly. 
17 	
Q. 	
They would come and go, come and go. 
18 	
What about the assistant that was his 
19 personal assistant that would fly with him? 
20 	
A. 	
Annie Taylor. It was an English girl that 
21 would travel with him a lot, and became the personal 
22 	
assistant. But most of the time it was Ms. Maxwell that 
23 traveled with him all the time. 
24 	
Q. 	
She was basically like his -- 
25

Girlfriend, whatever it was. Boss,

Mr. Barry E. Krischer, State Attorney 
Office of the State Attorney 
Fifteenth Judicial Circuit 
401 North Dixie Highway 
West Palm Beach, FL 33401 
Dear Mr. Krischer, 
Please find enclosed the probable cause affidavits and case filing packages thus far 
resulting from the Palm Beach Police Department's investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah 
Kellen and Haley Robson. The submission of these documents are both in response to 
Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek's request for them and to serve as the Palm 
Beach Police Department's presentation for prosecution. 
I know that you agree that it is our shared responsibility to seek justice and to serve the 
public interest by discharging our duties with fairness and accountability. I must renew my 
prior observation to you that I continue to find your office's treatment of these cases highly 
unusual. It is regrettable that I am forced to communicate in this manner but my most 
recent telephone calls to you and those of the lead detective to your assigned attorneys 
have been unanswered and messages remain unreturned. 
After giving this much thought and consideration, I must urge you to examine the unusual 
course that your office's handling of this matter has taken and consider if good and 
sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the prosecution of these 
cases. 
Sincerely, 
ki.uJit,m@S Rte,

From March 15, 2005, through February 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department conducted a sexual 
battery investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. Sworn taped statements were 
taken from five victims and seventeen witnesses concerning massages and unlawful sexual activity that took place 
at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach. Several of the victims were recruited by and 
brought to the residence by Haley Robson to perform massages for Epstein, for which Robson received 
monetary compensation. During the visit they would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who in 
turn would record their telephone numbers and name. The victims would be brought to Epstein's bedroom to 
provide the massage. Epstein would enter the room and order the victims to remove their clothing to provide the 
massage. As the victims complied and provided the massages, Epstein would rub his fingers on their vaginas. 
On occasion, Epstein would introduce a massager/vibrator and rub the victims vaginas as they provided the 
massage. On three separate occasions, Epstein had intercourse and inserted his penis/fingers in the victims 
vaginas. At the conclusion of the massages the victims were paid sums of money ranging from $200 - $1,000. 
The facts, as reported, are as follows: 
On 03/15/2005, A fourteen year old white female, hereinafter referred to as "SG," dob 05/13/1990, and 
her family reported unlawful sexual activity which occurred at a residence within the Town of Palm Beach. SG 
reported that a subject known to her as "Jeff' had touched her vaginal area with a vibrator/massager while within 
his residence. "Jeff' was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up. 
During a sworn taped interview, SG stated that Haley Robson, dob 04/09/1986, a cousin of SG's 
boyfriend and classmate at 
l, worked for a wealthy man and did sexual favors for 
him. She also admitted that Robson had offered her an opportunity to make money. During the beginning of 
the month of February 2005, SG explained that she was first approached by Robson to go with her to Epstein's 
house. SG stated that Robson along with a Hispanic female, later identified at 	
pick her up at 
her father's house on a Sunday. SG was not sure of the exact dates but knew it was a Sunday. SG told her 
father that they were going shopping but in reality Robson drove them to Palm Beach. During the drive a

conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age, 
she should say she was eighteen. It was later confirmed by the SG's.father that Robson picked his daughter up 
on February 6, 2005. According to SG's father, Robson drove a pick up truck. 
SG described Epstein's house as a two-story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the 
driveway. She recalled that Jeffs house was on a dead end street. Upon arriving at the house SG stated that 
they walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. A male approaching them 
asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Epstein. The male allowed them to continue 
walking up to the house. SG stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He 
allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. 
Shortly thereafter, Epstein and his assistant, described as white female with blond hair and later identified as 
Sarah Kellen, entered the kitchen. Epstein introduced himself to SG. SG described Epstein as being 
approximately forty-five years old, having a long face and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair. 
Robson and Epstein left the kitchen leaving SG alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. 
They all spoke briefly in the kitchen. SG was instructed to follow Kellen upstairs. SG recalled walking up a 
flight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room that had a massage table in it. Upon entering the room there 
was a large bathroom to the right and a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door on each side of 
the sofa. SG recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several photographs of 
naked women on a shelf. Kellen told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second. 
Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel and told SG to take off her clothes. SG stated Epstein 
was stern when he told her to take off her clothes. SG said she did not know what to do as she was the only one 
there in the room so she took off her shirt leaving her bra on. Epstein had removed his towel and told the SG to 
take off everything. SG stated Epstein was nude when he took his towel off, placing it on the floor as he laid 
down on the table. SG stated she then removed her pants leaving her thong panties on. Epstein then instructed 
her to give him a massage pointing to a specific lotion for her to use. As SG began to give Epstein the massage, 
he told her to get on his back. SG stated she straddled herself on Epstein's back whereby her exposed buttocks 
were touching Epstein's bare buttocks. SG said Epstein was specific in his instruction to her on how to massage 
him, telling her to go clockwise or counter clockwise. Epstein then turned over and instructed SG to massage his 
chest. SG was now standing on the ground and resumed massaging Epstein's chest area. SG stated Epstein held 
onto the small of her back as she massaged his chest and shoulder area. Epstein then turned to his side and 
started to rub his penis in an up and down motion. Epstein then pulled out a purple vibrator and began to

massage SG's vaginal area. SG stated there was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. 
SG recalled Epstein ejaculating because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Epstein 
then left the room and SG got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. SG said she 
was paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone 
number. As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred 
dollars that day for bringing her. 
During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the 
investigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson's cellular telephone 561-
308-0282. SG spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson, 
what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, "the more you do, the more you get paid." 
Robson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an 
appointment for SG to go to Epstein's house at 11:00 am on April 5, 2005. This message was recorded from 
SG's voice mail. 
Based on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein's residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of 
the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2005 revealed a telephone 
message for Epstein which stated Haley and SG's name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had 
informed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein's house. 
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson's residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the 
driveway, a red Dodge Neon. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was 
told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach. Robson was 
asked if she would accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the 
conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. Robson voluntarily came with us back to the Palm 
Beach Police Department. 
Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau 
where I obtained a taped, sworn statement. I began the interview by asking Robson how she became

Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At 
the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.

when he was going to travel to Palm Beach. Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that 
he is traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to "work" for Epstein. Robson 
stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters with him 
and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sarah still tries to call Robson's house and leaves messages. 
Sgt Frick entered the room and explained to Robson that based on her own statements, she had 
implicated herself by bringing underage girls to Epstein's house. Robson provided cellular telephone numbers for 
the girls she had mentioned previously. Additionally, she also provided possible addresses and areas in which 
they lived. 
As Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record 
any conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment " I'm like 
a Heidi Fleiss." (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was 
dropped off at her house without incident. 
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to speak with JS, a sixteen year-old female who was 
brought to Epstein's residence by Haley Robson. We met with JS's mother at their front door. We explained 
the ongoing investigation and asked to speak with JS as we had information that she had "worked" for Jeff. 
Mrs. S introduced us to her husband and allowed us entry into the home. We sat in the dining room and met 
with JS, Date of Birth 07-28-1988. As she was under the age of eighteen, Mrs S was advised we would be 
speaking with her. She expressed if her daughter had information, she wanted to assist. We interviewed JS, who 
denied having any inappropriate encounters with Jeff (Epstein). She stated she had gone to Jeff s house with 
Haley Robson approximately eight months ago and sat in the kitchen with the house chef, but nothing happened. 
As the parents were present during the interview, we felt that JS was withholding information from us. She made 
several comments as to putting the entire incident behind her. I left my telephone number and advised should she 
wish to speak with me again to telephone me. Sgt Frick and I thanked Mrs. S for her time and left the area. She 
stated she would ask JS again after we left as to what happened at Epstein's house. I informed her that JS had 
my telephone number and hopefully she would call.

assistant Sarah would telephone her every time Epstein was in the Town of Palm Beach and would place 
appointments for her to visit and work for Epstein. Each time something new was introduced, additional monies 
were produced and offered for AH to allow the acts to happen. AH consented to perform all these acts but was 
adamant that there was an understanding with Epstein that no vaginal penetration would occur with his penis. AH 
explained that Epstein's penis was deformed. AH explained that his penis was oval shaped. AH claimed when 
Epstein's penis was erect, it was thick toward the bottom but was thin and small toward the head portion. AH 
called Epstein's penis "egg-shaped." AH stated Epstein would photograph Marcinkova and her naked and 
having sex and proudly display the photographs within the home. AH stated during one visit to Epstein's house 
in which she provided a massage to Epstein, his female friend, Nada Marcinkova, was also present. AH 
provided the massage in which Marcinkova and her would fondle each others breasts and kiss for Epstein to 
enjoy. Towards the end of this massage, Epstein grabbed AH and turned her over onto her stomach on the 
massage table and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. AH stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her 
vagina. AH became upset over this. She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as he continued 
to pump inside her. She screamed "No!" and Epstein stopped. She told him that she did not want to have his 
penis inside of her. Epstein did not ejaculate inside of her and apologized for his actions and subsequently paid 
her a thousand dollars for that visit. AH stated she knows he still displays her photographs through out the house.

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein's home located at 
358 El Brillo•Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master 
bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the 
master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked 
young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the 
house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a 
duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn 
on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers 
were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been 
interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other 
names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I 
have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. 
During the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein's 
bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside 
Epstein's bed that contained a bottle of "Joy Jelly," which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage 
tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein's 
bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located 
in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein's desk. A computer was located 
which was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer's hard drive was reviewed 
which showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these 
images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein's desk. 
On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob 02/29/1988. During a sworn taped 
statement, ML stated that when she was sixteen years old she was taken to Epstein's house to provide a massage 
for money. ML stated it was before Christmas last year (2004) when an associate, YL, approached her and 
asked if she needed to make money for Christmas. YL made arrangements to take ML to the house and drove 
ML to the house to "work." They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. ML was unable to 
remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein's assistant. She was led 
upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the 
lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and 
bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom. ML described the bathroom as a large 
spacious bathroom with a steam room and shower beside it. ML was introduced to Epstein who was on the 
phone when she entered the room. Epstein was wearing a white towel and laid on his stomach so that ML may

massage his feet and calves. ML started the massage with the oils Epstein chose and rubbed his feet and calves. 
Epstein got off the phone and requested she massage his back as well. ML began rubbing his back and got to 
the small of his back. During the rubbing of his back, Epstein asked her to get comfortable. He requested she 
remove her pants and shirt. ML removed her shirt and pulled her pants off. ML stayed in her bra and thong 
panties. As she finished massaging the small of Epstein's back, he then turned onto his back. Epstein 
instructed ML to rub his chest and pinch his nipples. As she began to rub his chest, Epstein asked her questions 
about herself. ML remembered telling him she attended Royal Palm Beach High School. Epstein asked her if 
she was sexually active. Before ML could answer, he also asked what sexual position does she enjoy. ML 
stated she was shy and didn't like talking about those things. She continued rubbing his chest. Epstein reached 
up and unsnapped her bra from the front. ML explained the bra she used had a front snapping device. Epstein 
rubbed her breasts and asked her if she like having her breasts rubbed. ML said "no, I don't like that." Epstein 
then removed his towel and laid on the bed naked exposing his penis to ML. He began touching his penis and 
masturbated as he touched her breasts. ML explained Epstein then touched her vaginal area by rubbing her 
vagina with his fingers on the outside of her thong panties. ML tensed up and stated Epstein was aware that she 
was uncomfortable. ML stated that Epstein said to her, "Relax, I'm not going inside." She further explained 
Epstein commented to her how beautiful and sexy she was. Epstein then moved her thong panties to one side 
and began stroking her clitoris. ML said, "He commented how hard my clit was." He then inserted two fingers in 
her vagina and was stroking her within her vagina. She tried pulling back to pull out his fingers from within her 
vagina. Epstein removed his fingers from within her vagina and apologized for putting his fingers inside her. 
During this time, he kept his hand on her vaginal area and continued to rub her vagina. ML stated he rubbed her 
really hard as he was masturbating. ML said he climaxed onto the towel he had been previously wearing and got 
up from the table. Epstein told her there was $200.00 dollars for her on the dresser within the master bathroom. 
Epstein also told her that there was an additional $100.00 that was to be given to YL for bringing her there to 
massage him. Epstein told her to leave her telephone number with his assistant as he wanted to see her again. 
Epstein stated his assistant would contact her to work again soon. I asked her if she ever received any formal 
massage training to which ML stated she did not. ML stated it was the only time she ever went to work for Jeff 
and knew what happened to her was wrong. She further stated that she had never been contacted for any 
additional work. 
On January 9, 2006, I located and interviewed another victim, CL, dob 04/29/1988. CL was identified 
as a potential victim/witness from information obtained during trash pulls from Epstein's residence. CL stated she

not wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back. 
Epstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein 
began masturbating himself . Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein 
continued to masturbate himself as he stroked her vagina. Epstein ejaculated on his towel and paid CL $200.00 
for the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could 
happen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein's houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where 
she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for 
CL to return to "work." CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein's bedroom area by Sarah who 
prepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein had CL remove her 
clothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his 
back. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and 
downward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the 
other hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the towel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid 
$200.00 for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would 
happen. CL wanted to notify authorities however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her 
family. 
During the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim 
through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books retrieved 
from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age 
eighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same 
massage routine when they went to "work" for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and 
made appointments for the females to "work" for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein's house and were 
led upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein's bedroom. Epstein would then 
enter the room wearing only a towel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the 
massage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on

their vaginal area. He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The 
girls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage. 
On November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated 
he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he 
was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for 
Epstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private 
plane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein's home. Alessi stated Epstein 
receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards 
the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi 
stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's 
bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things 
going on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he 
would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. 
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage. 
On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn 
taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from 
November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, 
chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about 
masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have 
one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated 
he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would 
meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen 
area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or 
Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses 
appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. 
He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for 
one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high 
school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. 
He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators 
and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them 
away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl 
he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the 
girl always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, 
and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High 
School after AH high school drama performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and 
direction to extend the rental contract. 
During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records 
from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these 
records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims. 
These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they 
victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley 
Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated 
the encounters with AH, AD, 	
_ _ _ _, 
Beale and i• 	during the time frame the girls 
stated they occurred. 
Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein's private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation. 
The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein's plane at Palm Beach International airport. These 
records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen This comparison found that all the phone calls 
Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein 
was in Palm Beach. 
Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time of these incidents was fifty one years of age, did have vaginal intercourse 
either with his penis or digitally with AH, ML, CL and  	
who were minors at the time this occurred, and 
who at the time of the incident was fifty two years of age, did use a vibrator on the external vaginal area of SG, a 
fourteen year old minor. Therefore, as Sarah Kellen coordinated and aided in the recruitment of minors to 
frequent Epstein's house so that sexual services were provided to Epstein, scheduled the said minors to return to 
the work for Epstein, secured their appointments for the purpose of sexual activity and lewd and lascivious acts 
and arranged the bedroom for said minors, there is sufficient probable cause to charge Sarah Kellen with four 
counts of Principal in the 1" degree Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor, in violation of Florida State Statute 
794.05(1) , a second degree felony and there is sufficient probable cause to charge her with Lewd and 
Lascivious Molestation, in violation of Florida State Statute 800.04 (5), a second degree felony.

Race/Sex: White Male 
DOB:

Charges: 	
Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor (4) counts 
Lewd and Lascivious Molestation 
From March 15, 2005, through February 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department conducted a sexual 
battery investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. Sworn taped statements were 
taken from five victims and seventeen witnesses concerning massages and unlawful sexual activity that took place 
at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach. Several of the victims were recruited by and 
brought to the residence by Haley Robson to perform massages for Epstein, for which Robson received 
monetary compensation. During the visit they would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who in 
turn would record their telephone numbers and name. The victims would be brought to Epstein's bedroom to 
provide the massage. Epstein would enter the room and order the victims to remove their clothing to provide the 
massage. As the victims complied and provided the massages, Epstein would rub his fingers on their vaginas. 
On occasion, Epstein would introduce a massager/vibrator and rub the victims vaginas as they provided the 
massage. On three separate occasions, Epstein had intercourse and inserted his penis/fingers in the victims 
vaginas. At the conclusion of the massages the victims were paid sums of money ranging from $200 - $1,000. 
The facts, as reported, are as follows: 
On 03/15/2005, A fourteen year old white female, hereinafter referred to as "SG," dob 05/13/1990, and 
her family reported unlawful sexual activity which occurred at a residence within the Town of Palm Beach. SG 
reported that a subject known to her as "Jeff' had touched her vaginal area with a vibrator/massager while within 
his residence. "Jeff' was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up. 
During a sworn taped interview, SG stated that Haley Robson, dob 04/09/1986, a cousin of SG's 
boyfriend and classmate at Royal Palm Beach High School, worked for a wealthy man and did sexual favors for 
him. She also admitted that Robson had offered her an opportunity to make money. During the beginning of 
the month of February 2005, SG explained that she was first approached by Robson to go with her to Epstein's 
house. SG stated that Robson along with a Hispanic female, later identified at 	
s, pick her up at 
her father's house on a Sunday. SG was not sure of the exact dates but knew it was a Sunday. SG told her 
father that they were going shopping but in reality Robson drove them to Palm Beach. During the drive a

conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age, 
she should say she was eighteen. It was later confirmed by the SG's.father that Robson picked his daughter up 
on February 6, 2005. According to SG's father, Robson drove a pick up truck. 
SG described Epstein's house as a two-story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the 
driveway. She recalled that Jeffs house was on a dead end street. Upon arriving at the house SG stated that 
they walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. A male approaching them 
asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Epstein. The male allowed them to continue 
walking up to the house. SG stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He 
allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. 
Shortly thereafter, Epstein and his assistant, described as white female with blond hair and later identified as 
Sarah Kellen, entered the kitchen. Epstein introduced himself to SG. SG described Epstein as being 
approximately forty-five years old, having a long face and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair. 
Robson and Epstein left the kitchen leaving SG alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. 
They all spoke briefly in the kitchen. SG was instructed to follow Kellen upstairs. SG recalled walking up a 
flight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room that had a massage table in it. Upon entering the room there 
was a large bathroom to the right and a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door on each side of 
the sofa. SG recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several photographs of 
naked women on a shelf. Kellen told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second. 
Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel and told SG to take off her clothes. SG stated Epstein 
was stern when he told her to take off her clothes. SG said she did not know what to do as she was the only one 
there in the room so she took off her shirt leaving her bra on. Epstein had removed his towel and told the SG to 
take off everything. SG stated Epstein was nude when he took his towel off, placing it on the floor as he laid 
down on the table. SG stated she then removed her pants leaving her thong panties on. Epstein then instructed 
her to give him a massage pointing to a specific lotion for her to use. As SG began to give Epstein the massage, 
he told her to get on his back. SG stated she straddled herself on Epstein's back whereby her exposed buttocks 
were touching Epstein's bare buttocks. SG said Epstein was specific in his instruction to her on how to massage 
him, telling her to go clockwise or counter clockwise. Epstein then turned over and instructed SG to massage his 
chest. SG was now standing on the ground and resumed massaging Epstein's chest area. SG stated Epstein held 
onto the small of her back as she massaged his chest and shoulder area. Epstein then turned to his side and 
started to rub his penis in an up and down motion. Epstein then pulled out a purple vibrator and began to

massage SG's vaginal area. SG stated there was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. 
SG recalled Epstein ejaculating because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Epstein 
then left the room and SG got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. SG said she 
was paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone 
number. As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred 
dollars that day for bringing her. 
During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the 
investigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson's cellular telephone 561-
308-0282. SG spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson, 
what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, "the more you do, the more you get paid." 
Robson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an 
appointment for SG to go to Epstein's house at 11:00 am on April 5, 2005. This message was recorded from 
SG's voice mail. 
Based on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein's residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of 
the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2005 revealed a telephone 
message for Epstein which stated Haley and SG's name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had 
informed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein's house. 
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson's residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the 
driveway, a red Dodge Neon. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was 
told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach. Robson was 
asked if she would accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the 
conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. Robson voluntarily came with us back to the Palm 
Beach Police Department. 
Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau 
where I obtained a taped, sworn statement. I began the interview by asking Robson how she became 
acquainted with Epstein. Robson stated that approximately two years ago, just after she turned 17 years of age, 
she was approached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked 
if she wanted to make money. She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. 
Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.

Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked Robson up and she was taken to 
Epstein's house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She 
was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known 
to her as Jeff Epstein's bedroom. Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She 
brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sarah, then left the room and informed 
Robson Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel 
and laid nude on the massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson 
to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated "He tried to touch me and I stopped him." I asked how he 
tried to touch her. Robson stated that Epstein grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson told 
Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At 
the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200. 
After the massage Epstein stated to Robson that he understood she was not comfortable, but he would 
pay her if she brought over some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to bring 
a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson stated that in total she only 
remembers six girls that she brought to see Epstein, each time she was paid $200. Robson stated she had 
brought the following girls: SG, 	
T 	
' , 	
J.S. (a16 year old female), YL (a 16 year old 
female) and 	 Robson said that at the time she brought these girls to Epstein's house they were a1114 
through 16 years of age. I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised SG was the youngest as 
she was fourteen when the massage occurred. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when 
they arrived. They were told they would provide a massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked 
her if SG was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew that SG 
wanted to make money. She approached SG and explained about going to work for Jeff, SG agreed and 
arrangements were made to bring her to Epstein's house on a weekend. Robson stated that she and ___ 
(Later identified as 	
_ ) picked up SG at her house. Robson stated that at that time she was driving 
a red pickup truck. They traveled to Epstein's house and entered through the kitchen door. They met with the 
house chef and Epstein's assistant Sarah. SG was introduced to Epstein while they were in the kitchen area. 
Sarah led SG upstairs and Epstein went upstairs. When the massage was over SG returned to the kitchen area. 
Robson stated she was paid $200.00 for bringing SG to Epstein's house. Robson stated SG told her she was 
paid $300.00 for the massage. 
Robson stated that SG was the last person she brought to Epstein's house. She had changed her cellular 
number to avoid being contacted by Sarah. She continued stating that she had no direct contact with Epstein

when he was going to travel to Palm Beach. Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that 
he is traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to "work" for Epstein. Robson 
stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters with him 
and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sarah still tries to call Robson's house and leaves messages. 
Sgt Frick entered the room and explained to Robson that based on her own statements, she had 
implicated herself by bringing underage girls to Epstein's house. Robson provided cellular telephone numbers for 
the girls she had mentioned previously. Additionally, she also provided possible addresses and areas in which 
they lived. 
As Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record 
any conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment " I'm like 
a Heidi Fleiss." (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was 
dropped off at her house without incident. 
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to speak with JS, a sixteen year-old female who was 
brought to Epstein's residence by Haley Robson. We met with JS's mother at their front door. We explained 
the ongoing investigation and asked to speak with JS as we had information that she had "worked" for Jeff. 
Mrs. S introduced us to her husband and allowed us entry into the home. We sat in the dining room and met 
with JS, Date of Birth 07-28-1988. As she was under the age of eighteen, Mrs S was advised we would be 
speaking with her. She expressed if her daughter had information, she wanted to assist. We interviewed JS, who 
denied having any inappropriate encounters with Jeff (Epstein). She stated she had gone to Jeff's house with 
Haley Robson approximately eight months ago and sat in the kitchen with the house chef, but nothing happened. 
As the parents were present during the interview, we felt that JS was withholding information from us. She made 
several comments as to putting the entire incident behind her. I left my telephone number and advised should she 
wish to speak with me again to telephone me. Sgt Frick and I thanked Mrs. S for her time and left the area. She 
stated she would ask JS again after we left as to what happened at Epstein's house. I informed her that JS had 
my telephone number and hopefully she would call.

he turned the towel around so that the opening would allow him to expose himself. After he cleaned himself off 
with the towel he instructed MD the massage was done and to get dressed and meet with him downstairs. MD

with Epstein's back and legs, Epstein then turned over onto his back. MD started to rub his chest and he began 
masturbating. As MD rubbed his chest, Epstein leaned over and produced a massager/vibrator. He turned it on 
and began rubbing MD's vagina and masturbating himself at the same time. MD stated she continued to rub his 
chest as this was occurring. She described the vibrator/massager as large grey with a large head. Epstein 
rubbed her vagina for approximately two to three minutes with the massager/vibrator. He then removed the 
vibrator from her vaginal area and concentrated on masturbating himself. MD stated Epstein climaxed onto the 
towel again and informed her that the massage was done. MD got dressed and met with

desire to return to the house. MD was asked if she received any formal massage training. She advised she had 
no formal training. MD was asked if Epstein knew her real age. MD stated he knew, as he asked her questions 
about herself and high school. He was aware she attended, and is still attending Royal Palm Beach High School.

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein's home located at 
358 El Brillo-Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master 
bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the 
master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked 
young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the 
house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a 
duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn 
on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers 
were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been 
interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other 
names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I 
have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. 
During the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein's 
bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside 
Epstein's bed that contained a bottle of "Joy Jelly," which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage 
tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein's 
bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located 
in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein's desk. A computer was located 
which was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer's hard drive was reviewed 
which showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these 
images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein's desk. 
On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob 02/29/1988. During a sworn taped 
statement, ML stated that when she was sixteen years old she was taken to Epstein's house to provide a massage 
for money. ML stated it was before Christmas last year (2004) when an associate, YL, approached her and 
asked if she needed to make money for Christmas. YL made arrangements to take ML to the house and drove 
ML to the house to "work." They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. ML was unable to 
remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein's assistant. She was led 
upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the 
lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and 
bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom. ML described the bathroom as a large 
spacious bathroom with a steam room and shower beside it. ML was introduced to Epstein who was on the 
phone when she entered the room. Epstein was wearing a white towel and laid on his stomach so that ML may

massage his feet and calves. ML started the massage with the oils Epstein chose and rubbed his feet and calves. 
Epstein got off the phone and requested she massage his back as well. ML began rubbing his back and got to 
the small of his back. During the rubbing of his back, Epstein asked her to get comfortable. He requested she 
remove her pants and shirt. ML removed her shirt and pulled her pants off. ML stayed in her bra and thong 
panties. As she finished massaging the small of Epstein's back, he then turned onto his back. Epstein 
instructed ML to rub his chest and pinch his nipples. As she began to rub his chest, Epstein asked her questions 
about herself. ML remembered telling him she attended Royal Palm Beach High School. Epstein asked her if 
she was sexually active. Before ML could answer, he also asked what sexual position does she enjoy. ML 
stated she was shy and didn't like talking about those things. She continued rubbing his chest. Epstein reached 
up and unsnapped her bra from the front. ML explained the bra she used had a front snapping device. Epstein 
rubbed her breasts and asked her if she like having her breasts rubbed. ML said "no, I don't like that." Epstein 
then removed his towel and laid on the bed naked exposing his penis to ML. He began touching his penis and 
masturbated as he touched her breasts. ML explained Epstein then touched her vaginal area by rubbing her 
vagina with his fingers on the outside of her thong panties. ML tensed up and stated Epstein was aware that she 
was uncomfortable. ML stated that Epstein said to her, "Relax, I'm not going inside." She further explained 
Epstein commented to her how beautiful and sexy she was. Epstein then moved her thong panties to one side 
and began stroking her clitoris. ML said, "He commented how hard my clit was." He then inserted two fingers in 
her vagina and was stroking her within her vagina. She tried pulling back to pull out his fingers from within her 
vagina. Epstein removed his fingers from within her vagina and apologized for putting his fmgers inside her. 
During this time, he kept his hand on her vaginal area and continued to rub her vagina. ML stated he rubbed her 
really hard as he was masturbating. ML said he climaxed onto the towel he had been previously wearing and got 
up from the table. Epstein told her there was $200.00 dollars for her on the dresser within the master bathroom. 
Epstein also told her that there was an additional $100.00 that was to be given to YL for bringing her there to 
massage him. Epstein told her to leave her telephone number with his assistant as he wanted to see her again. 
Epstein stated his assistant would contact her to work again soon. I asked her if she ever received any formal 
massage training to which ML stated she did not. ML stated it was the only time she ever went to work for Jeff 
and knew what happened to her was wrong. She further stated that she had never been contacted for any 
additional work. 
On January 9, 2006, I located and interviewed another victim, CL, dob 04/29/1988. CL was identified 
as a potential victim/witness from information obtained during trash pulls from Epstein's residence. CL stated she 
met Epstein when she was fifteen years of age. She was approached by a friend from Royal Palm Beach High 
School, Tatum Miller, to be taken to Jeffrey Epstein's house to work. She was originally told she would be able

to model lingerie for a wealthy Palm Beacher. CL was taken to Epstein's house located on El BrilloWay. Miller 
introduced CL to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had his personal chef prepare dinner for CL and Miller. At the 
conclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large 
massage table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a towel. Miller 
informed CL that they were going to provide a massage on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead 
of modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had 
told CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did 
not wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back. 
Epstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein 
began masturbating himself . Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein 
continued to masturbate himself as he stroked her vagina. Epstein ejaculated on his towel and paid CL $200.00 
for the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could 
happen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein's houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where 
she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for 
CL to return to "work." CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein's bedroom area by Sarah who 
prepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein had CL remove her 
clothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his 
back. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and 
downward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the 
other hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the towel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid 
$200.00 for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would 
happen. CL wanted to notify authorities however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her 
family. 
During the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim 
through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books retrieved 
from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age 
eighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same 
massage routine when they went to "work" for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and 
made appointments for the females to "work" for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein's house and were 
led upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein's bedroom. Epstein would then 
enter the room wearing only a towel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the 
massage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on

their vaginal area. He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The 
girls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage. 
On November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated 
he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he 
was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for 
Epstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private 
plane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein's home. Alessi stated Epstein 
receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards 
the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi 
stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's 
bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things 
going on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he 
would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. 
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage. 
On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn 
taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from 
November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, 
chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about 
masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have 
one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated 
he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would 
meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen 
area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or 
Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses 
appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. 
He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for 
one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high 
school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. 
He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators 
and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them 
away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl 
he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the 
girl always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, 
and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High 
School after AH high school drama performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and 
direction to extend the rental contract. 
During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records 
from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these 
records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims. 
These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they 
victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley 
Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated 
the encounters with AH, AD, 	
, 
Beale and r 	during the time frame the girls 
stated they occurred. 
Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein's private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation. 
The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein's plane at Palm Beach International airport. These 
records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen This comparison found that all the phone calls 
Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein 
was in Palm Beach. 
Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time of these incidents was fifty one years of age, did have vaginal intercourse 
either with his penis or digitally with AH, ML, CL and I _. who were minors at the time this occurred, and 
who at the time of the incident was fifty two years of age, did use a vibrator on the external vaginal area of SG, a 
fourteen year old minor. Therefore, as Sarah Kellen coordinated and aided in the recruitment of minors to 
frequent Epstein's house so that sexual services were provided to Epstein, scheduled the said minors to return to 
the work for Epstein, secured their appointments for the purpose of sexual activity and lewd and lascivious acts 
and arranged the bedroom for said minors, there is sufficient probable cause to charge Sarah Kellen with four 
counts of Principal in the 1" degree Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor, in violation of Florida State Statute 
794.05(1) , a second degree felony and there is sufficient probable cause to charge her with Lewd and 
Lascivious Molestation, in violation of Florida State Statute 800.04 (5), a second degree felony.

Police Case#: 05-368 (3) 
Defendant: Haley Robson 
Race/Sex: 	
'White Female 
DOB: 	
04-09-1986 
Charges: 	
Lewd and Lascivious Act on a child under 16 years of age 800.04(6)(2b) 
From March 15, 2005, through February 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department conducted a sexual 
battery investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. Sworn taped statements were 
taken from five victims and seventeen witnesses concerning massages and unlawful sexual activity that took place 
at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein; 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach. Several of the victims were recruited by and 
brought to the residence by Haley Robson to perform massages for Epstein, for which Robson received 
monetary compensation. During the visit they would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who in 
turn would record their telephone numbers and name. The victims would be brought to Epstein's bedroom to 
provide the massage. Epstein would enter the room and order the victims to remove their clothing to provide the 
massage. As the victims complied and provided the massages, Epstein would rub his fingers on their vaginas. 
On occasion, Epstein would introduce a massager/vibrator and rub the victims vaginas as they provided the 
massage. On three separate occasions, Epstein had intercourse and inserted his penis/fingers in the victims 
vaginas. At the conclusion of the massages the victims were paid sums of money ranging from $200 - $1,000. 
The facts, as reported, are as follows: 
On 03/15/2005, A fourteen year old white female, hereinafter referred to as "SG," dob 05/13/1990, and 
her family reported unlawful sexual activity which occurred at a residence within the Town of Palm Beach. SG 
reported that a subject known to her as "Jeff" had touched her vaginal area with a vibrator/massager while within 
his residence. "Jeff' was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up. 
During a sworn taped interview, SG stated that Haley Robson, dob 04/09/1986, a cousin of SG's 
boyfriend and classmate at Royal Palm Beach High School, worked for a wealthy man and did sexual favors for 
him. She also admitted that Robson had offered her an opportunity to make money. During the beginning of 
the month of February 2005, SG explained that she was first approached by Robson to go with her to Epstein's 
house. SG stated that Robson along with a Hispanic female, later identified at 	
, pick her up at 
her father's house on a Sunday. SG was not sure of the exact dates but knew it was a Sunday. SG told her 
father that they were going shopping but in reality Robson drove them to Palm Beach. During the drive a 
conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age,

conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age, 
she should say she was eighteen. It was later confirmed by the SG's father that Robson picked his daughter up 
on February 6, 2005. According to SG's father, Robson drove a pick up truck. 
SG described Epstein's house as a two-story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the 
driveway. She recalled that Jeffs house was on a dead end street. Upon arriving at the house SG stated that 
they walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. A male approaching them 
asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Epstein. The male allowed them to continue 
walking up to the house. SG stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He 
allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. 
Shortly thereafter, Epstein and his assistant, described as white female with blond hair and later identified as 
Sarah Kellen, entered the kitchen. Epstein introduced himself to SG. SG described Epstein as being 
approximately forty-five years old, having a long face and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair. 
Robson and Epstein left the kitchen leaving SG alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. 
They all spoke briefly in the kitchen. SG was instructed to follow Kellen upstairs. SG recalled walking up a 
flight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room that had a massage table in it. Upon entering the room there 
was a large bathroom to the right and a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door on each side of 
the sofa. SG recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several photographs of 
naked women on a shelf. Kellen told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second. 
Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel and told SG to take off her clothes. SG stated Epstein 
was stem when he told her to take off her clothes. SG said she did not know what to do as she was the only one 
there in the room so she took off her shirt leaving her bra on. Epstein had removed his towel and told the SG to 
take off everything. SG stated Epstein was nude when he took his towel off, placing it on the floor as he laid 
down on the table. SG stated she then removed her pants leaving her thong panties on. Epstein then instructed 
her to give him a massage pointing to a specific lotion for her to use. As SG began to give Epstein the massage, 
he told her to get on his back. SG stated she straddled herself on Epstein's back whereby her exposed buttocks 
were touching Epstein's bare buttocks. SG said Epstein was specific in his instruction to her on how to massage 
him, telling her to go clockwise or counter clockwise. Epstein then turned over and instructed SG to massage his 
chest. SG was now standing on the ground and resumed massaging Epstein's chest area. SG stated Epstein held 
onto the small of her back as she massaged his chest and shoulder area. Epstein then turned to his side and 
started to rub his penis in an up and down motion. Epstein then pulled out a purple vibrator and began to

massage SG's vaginal area. SG stated there was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. 
SG recalled Epstein ejaculating because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Epstein 
then left the room and SG got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. SG said she 
was paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone 
number. As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred 
dollars that day for bringing her. 
During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the 
investigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson's cellular telephone 561-
308-0282. SG spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson, 
what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, "the more you do, the more you get paid." 
Robson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an 
appointment for SG to go to Epstein's house at 11:00 am on April 5, 2005. This message was recorded from 
SG's voice mail. 
Based on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein's residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of 
the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2005 revealed a telephone 
message for Epstein which stated Haley and SG's name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had 
informed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein's house. 
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson's residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the 
driveway, a red Dodge Neon. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was 
told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach. Robson was 
asked if she would accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the 
conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. Robson voluntarily came with us back to the Palm 
Beach Police Department. 
Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau 
where I obtained a taped, sworn statement. I began the interview by asking Robson how she became 
acquainted with Epstein. Robson stated that approximately two years ago, just after she turned 17 years of age, 
she was approached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked 
if she wanted to make money. She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. 
Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.

Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked Robson up and she was taken to 
Epstein's house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She 
was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known 
to her as Jeff Epstein's bedroom. Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She 
brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sarah, then left the room and informed 
Robson Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel 
and laid nude on the massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson 
to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated "He tried to touch me and I stopped him." I asked how he 
tried to touch her. Robson stated that Epstein grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson told 
Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At 
the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200. 
After the massage Epstein stated to Robson that he understood she was not comfortable, but he would 
pay her if she brought over some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to bring 
a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson stated that in total she only 
remembers six girls that she brought to see Epstein, each time she was paid $200. Robson stated she had 
brought the following girls: SG, 	
— 	
• 	
J.S. (a16 year old female), YL (a 16 year old 
female) and -___ 	
Robson said that at the time she brought these girls to Epstein's house they were al114 
through 16 years of age. I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised SG was the youngest as 
she was fourteen when the massage occurred. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when 
they arrived. They were told they would provide a massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked 
her if SG was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew that SG 
wanted to make money. She approached SG and explained about going to work for Jeff, SG agreed and 
arrangements were made to bring her to Epstein's house on a weekend. Robson stated that she and 	
 
(Later identified as 	
_ ) picked up SG at her house. Robson stated that at that time she was driving 
a red pickup truck. They traveled to Epstein's house and entered through the kitchen door. They met with the 
house chef and Epstein's assistant Sarah. SG was introduced to Epstein while they were in the kitchen area. 
Sarah led SG upstairs and Epstein went upstairs. When the massage was over SG returned to the kitchen area. 
Robson stated she was paid $200.00 for bringing SG to Epstein's house. Robson stated SG told her she was 
paid $300.00 for the massage. 
Robson stated that SG was the last person she brought to Epstein's house. She had changed her cellular 
number to avoid being contacted by Sarah. She continued stating that she had no direct contact with Epstein

when he was going to travel to Palm Beach. Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that 
he is traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to "work" for Epstein. Robson 
stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters with him 
and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sarah still tries to call Robson's house and leaves messages. 
Sgt Frick entered the room and explained to Robson that based on her own statements, she had 
implicated herself by bringing underage girls to Epstein's house. Robson provided cellular telephone numbers for 
the girls she had mentioned previously. Additionally, she also provided possible addresses and areas in which 
they lived. 
As Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record 
any conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment " I'm like 
a Heidi Fleiss." (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was 
dropped off at her house without incident. 
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to speak with JS, a sixteen year-old female who was 
brought to Epstein's residence by Haley Robson. We met with JS's mother at their front door. We explained 
the ongoing investigation and asked to speak with JS as we had information that she had "worked" for Jeff. 
Mrs. S introduced us to her husband and allowed us entry into the home. We sat in the dining room and met 
with JS, Date of Birth 07-28-1988. As she was under the age of eighteen, Mrs S was advised we would be 
speaking with her. She expressed if her daughter had information, she wanted to assist. We interviewed JS, who 
denied having any inappropriate encounters with Jeff (Epstein). She stated she had gone to Jeff's house with 
Haley Robson approximately eight months ago and sat in the kitchen with the house chef, but nothing happened. 
As the parents were present during the interview, we felt that JS was withholding information from us. She made 
several comments as to putting the entire incident behind her. I left my telephone number and advised should she 
wish to speak with me again to telephone me. Sgt Frick and I thanked Mrs. S for her time and left the area. She 
stated she would ask JS again after we left as to what happened at Epstein's house. I informed her that JS had 
my telephone number and hopefully she would call.

introduced to Sarah and Epstein. She was taken upstairs to a bedroom by Sarah who set the room up with a 
massage bed and brought out the oils to use. Epstein then entered the room wearing a towel. He laid on the 
table and picked out a lotion for JS to rub on him. At one point during the massage he tried to remove her shirt, 
at which point she became very upset and discontinued the massage. Both JS and Epstein had a verbal 
disagreement, at which time she left without being paid. She got with Haley Robson who was sitting in the 
kitchen and told her "let's go." JS advised she received no money for that day. JS also said that Haley Robson 
had told her if she was uncomfortable with what was going on, to let him know and he'll stop. She knew that the 
more you do the more you get paid. JS advised that several weeks later she agreed to be taken a second time 
by Haley Robson. Once they arrived at the residence, Haley Robson sat in the kitchen and Sarah took her 
upstairs to the master bedroom again. Sarah set the room up with a massage bed and brought out the oils to 
use. Epstein then entered the room wearing a towel. He laid on the table and picked out a lotion for JS to rub 
on him. At one point during the massage he tried to touch her buttocks. As JS was wearing tight jeans and had a 
tight belt on Epstein was unable to touch her buttocks. Epstein then rolled onto his back during the massage and 
then attempted to touch her breasts. JS then became upset again and told Epstein she didn't want to be touched. 
JS discontinued the massage and was paid $200.00. JS then went downstairs where Haley Robson was waiting 
for her. She told Robson she wanted to leave. JS said she never returned to the house. JS stated she is aware

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein's home located at 
358 El Brillo-Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master 
bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the 
master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked 
young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the 
house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a 
duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn 
on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers 
were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been 
interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other 
names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I 
have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. 
During the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein's 
bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside 
Epstein's bed that contained a bottle of "Joy Jelly," which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage 
tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein's 
bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located 
in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein's desk. A computer was located 
which was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer's hard drive was reviewed 
which showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these 
images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein's desk. 
On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob 02/29/1988. During a sworn taped 
statement, ML stated that when she was sixteen years old she was taken to Epstein's house to provide a massage 
for money. ML stated it was before Christmas last year (2004) when an associate, YL, approached her and 
asked if she needed to make money for Christmas. YL made arrangements to take ML to the house and drove 
ML to the house to "work." They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. ML was unable to 
remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein's assistant. She was led 
upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the 
lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and 
bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom. ML described the bathroom as a large 
spacious bathroom with a steam room and shower beside it. ML was introduced to Epstein who was on the 
phone when she entered the room. Epstein was wearing a white towel and laid on his stomach so that ML may

massage his feet and calves. ML started the massage with the oils Epstein chose and rubbed his feet and calves. 
Epstein got off the phone and requested she massage his back as well. ML began rubbing his back and got to 
the small of his back. During the rubbing of his back, Epstein asked her to get comfortable. He requested she 
remove her pants and shirt. ML removed her shirt and pulled her pants off. ML stayed in her bra and thong 
panties. As she finished massaging the small of Epstein's back, he then turned onto his back. Epstein 
instructed ML to rub his chest and pinch his nipples. As she began to rub his chest, Epstein asked her questions 
about herself. ML remembered telling him she attended Royal Palm Beach High School. Epstein asked her if 
she was sexually active. Before ML could answer, he also asked what sexual position does she enjoy. ML 
stated she was shy and didn't like talking about those things. She continued rubbing his chest. Epstein reached 
up and unsnapped her bra from the front. ML explained the bra she used had a front snapping device. Epstein 
rubbed her breasts and asked her if she like having her breasts rubbed. ML said "no, I don't like that." Epstein 
then removed his towel and laid on the bed naked exposing his penis to ML. He began touching his penis and 
masturbated as he touched her breasts. ML explained Epstein then touched her vaginal area by rubbing her 
vagina with his fingers on the outside of her thong panties. ML tensed up and stated Epstein was aware that she 
was uncomfortable. ML stated that Epstein said to her, "Relax, I'm not going inside." She further explained 
Epstein commented to her how beautiful and sexy she was. Epstein then moved her thong panties to one side 
and began stroking her clitoris. ML said, "He commented how hard my clit was." He then inserted two fingers in 
her vagina and was stroking her within her vagina. She tried pulling back to pull out his fingers from within her 
vagina. Epstein removed his fingers from within her vagina and apologized for putting his fingers inside her. 
During this time, he kept his hand on her vaginal area and continued to rub her vagina. ML stated he rubbed her 
really hard as he was masturbating. ML said he climaxed onto the towel he had been previously wearing and got 
up from the table. Epstein told her there was $200.00 dollars for her on the dresser within the master bathroom. 
Epstein also told her that there was an additional $100.00 that was to be given to YL for bringing her there to 
massage him. Epstein told her to leave her telephone number with his assistant as he wanted to see her again. 
Epstein stated his assistant would contact her to work again soon. I asked her if she ever received any formal 
massage training to which ML stated she did not. ML stated it was the only time she ever went to work for Jeff 
and knew what happened to her was wrong. She further stated that she had never been contacted for any 
additional work. 
On January 9, 2006, I located and interviewed another victim, CL, dob 04/29/1988. CL was identified 
as a potential victim/witness from information obtained during trash pulls from Epstein's residence. CL stated she 
met Epstein when she was fifteen years of age. She was approached by a friend from Royal Palm Beach High 
School, Tatum Miller, to be taken to Jeffrey Epstein's house to work. She was originally told she would be able

to model lingerie for a wealthy Palm Beacher. CL was taken to Epstein's house located on El BrilloWay. Miller 
introduced CL to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had his personal chef prepare dinner for CL and Miller. At the 
conclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large 
massage table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a towel. Miller 
informed CL that they were going to provide a massage on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead 
of modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had 
told CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did 
not wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back. 
Epstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein 
began masturbating himself . Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein 
continued to masturbate himself as he stroked her vagina. Epstein ejaculated on his towel and paid CL $200.00 
for the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could 
happen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein's houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where 
she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for 
CL to return to "work." CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein's bedroom area by Sarah who 
prepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein had CL remove her 
clothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his 
back. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his forgers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and 
downward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the 
other hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the towel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid 
$200.00 for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would 
happen. CL wanted to notify authorities however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her 
family. 
During the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim 
through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books retrieved 
from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age 
eighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same 
massage routine when they went to "work" for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and 
made appointments for the females to "work" for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein's house and were 
led upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein's bedroom. Epstein would then 
enter the room wearing only a towel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the 
massage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on

their vaginal area. He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The 
girls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage. 
On November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated 
he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he 
was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for 
Epstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private 
plane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein's home. Alessi stated Epstein 
receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards 
the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi 
stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's 
bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things 
going on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he 
would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. 
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage. 
On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn 
taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from 
November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, 
chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about 
masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have 
one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated 
he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would 
meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen 
area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or 
Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses 
appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. 
He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for 
one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high 
school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. 
He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators 
and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them 
away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl 
he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the 
girl always needed rides to and from the house. 
Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary 
with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High School after AH high school drama 
performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and direction to extend the rental 
contract. 
During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records 
from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these 
records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims. 
These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they 
victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley 
Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated 
the encounters with AH, AD, 	 :, 
Beale and 	 during the time frame the girls 
stated they occurred. 
Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein's private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation. 
The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein's plane at Palm Beach International airport. These 
records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen This comparison found that all the phone calls 
Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein 
was in Palm Beach. 
As Epstein, who at the time of the incident was fifty two years of age, did commit lewd and lascivious 
molestation on SG, a fourteen year old minor, by using a vibrator on her external vaginal area and as Haley 
Robson recruited, set up the appointment and drove to Epstein's residence, knowing that SG was fourteen years 
old and knowing there would be unlawful sexual activity between SG and Epstein that Robson received monetary 
compensation for taking said fourteen year old female by Epstein, there is sufficient probable cause to arrest 
Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Act on victim under 16 years of age in violation of Florida State Statue 800.04 
(6)(2b) a second degree felony.

From March 15, 2005, through February 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department conducted a sexual 
battery investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. Sworn taped statements were 
taken from five victims and seventeen witnesses concerning massages and unlawful sexual activity that took place 
at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach. Several of the victims were recruited by and 
brought to the residence by Haley Robson to perform massages for Epstein, for which Robson received 
monetary compensation. During the visit they would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who in 
turn would record their telephone numbers and name. The victims would be brought to Epstein's bedroom to 
provide the massage. Epstein would enter the room and order the victims to remove their clothing to provide the 
massage. As the victims complied and provided the massages, Epstein would rub his fingers on their vaginas. 
On occasion, Epstein would introduce a massager/vibrator and rub the victims vaginas as they provided the 
massage. On three separate occasions, Epstein had intercourse and inserted his penis/fingers in the victims 
vaginas. At the conclusion of the massages the victims were paid sums of money ranging from $200 - $1,000. 
The facts, as reported, are as follows:

her family reported unlawful sexual activity which occurred at a residence within the Town of Palm Beach. SG 
reported that a subject known to her as "Jeff' had touched her vaginal area with a vibrator/massager while within 
his residence. "Jeff' was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up. 
During a sworn taped interview, SG stated that Haley Robson, dob 04/09/1986, a cousin of SG's 
boyfriend and classmate at Royal Palm Beach High School, worked for a wealthy man and did sexual favors for 
him. She also admitted that Robson had offered her an opportunity to make money. During the beginning of 
the month of February 2005, SG explained that she was first approached by Robson to go with her to Epstein's 
house. SG stated that Robson along with a Hispanic female, later identified at

her father's house on a Sunday. SG was not sure of the exact dates but knew it was a Sunday. SG told her

conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age, 
she should say she was eighteen. It was later confirmed by the SG's.father that Robson picked his daughter up 
on February 6, 2005. According to SG's father, Robson drove a pick up truck. 
SG described Epstein's house as a two-story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the 
driveway. She recalled that Jeffs house was on a dead end street. Upon arriving at the house SG stated that 
they walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. A male approaching them 
asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Epstein. The male allowed them to continue 
walking up to the house. SG stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He 
allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. 
Shortly thereafter, Epstein and his assistant, described as white female with blond hair and later identified as 
Sarah Kellen, entered the kitchen. Epstein introduced himself to SG. SG described Epstein as being 
approximately forty-five years old, having a long face and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair. 
Robson and Epstein left the kitchen leaving SG alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. 
They all spoke briefly in the kitchen. SG was instructed to follow Kellen upstairs. SG recalled walking up a 
flight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room that had a massage table in it. Upon entering the room there 
was a large bathroom to the right and a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door on each side of 
the sofa. SG recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several photographs of 
naked women on a shelf. Kellen told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second. 
Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel and told SG to take off her clothes. SG stated Epstein 
was stern when he told her to take off her clothes. SG said she did not know what to do as she was the only one 
there in the room so she took off her shirt leaving her bra on. Epstein had removed his towel and told the SG to

massage SG's vaginal area. SG stated there was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. 
SG recalled Epstein ejaculating because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Epstein 
then left the room and SG got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. SG said she 
was paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone 
number. M SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred 
dollars that day for bringing her. 
During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the 
investigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson's cellular telephone 561-
308-0282. SG spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson, 
what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, "the more you do, the more you get paid." 
Robson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an 
appointment for SG to go to Epstein's house at 11:00 am on April 5, 2005. This message was recorded from 
SG's voice mail. 
Based on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein's residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of 
the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2005 revealed a telephone 
message for Epstein which stated Haley and SG's name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had 
informed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein's house. 
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson's residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the 
driveway, a red Dodge Neon. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was 
told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach. Robson was 
asked if she would accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the 
conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. Robson voluntarily came with us back to the Palm 
Beach Police Department. 
Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau 
where I obtained a taped, sworn statement. I began the interview by asking Robson how she became 
acquainted with Epstein. Robson stated that approximately two years ago, just after she turned 17 years of age, 
she was approached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked 
if she wanted to make money. She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. 
Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.

Epstein's house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She 
was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known 
to her as Jeff Epstein's bedroom. Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She 
brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sarah, then left the room and informed 
Robson Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel 
and laid nude on the massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson 
to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated "He tried to touch me and I stopped him." I asked how he 
tried to touch her. Robson stated that Epstein grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson told 
Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At 
the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200. 
After the massage Epstein stated to Robson that he understood she was not comfortable, but he would 
pay her if she brought over some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to bring 
a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson stated that in total she only

through 16 years of age. I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised SG was the youngest as 
she was fourteen when the massage occurred. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when 
they arrived. They were told they would provide a massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked 
her if SG was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew that SG 
wanted to make money. She approached SG and explained about going to work for Jeff, SG agreed and

when he was going to travel to Palm Beach. Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that 
he is traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to "work" for Epstein. Robson 
stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters with him 
and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sarah still tries to call Robson's house and leaves messages. 
Sgt Frick entered the room and explained to Robson that based on her own statements, she had 
implicated herself by bringing underage girls to Epstein's house. Robson provided cellular telephone numbers for 
the girls she had mentioned previously. Additionally, she also provided possible addresses and areas in which 
they lived. 
As Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record 
any conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment " I'm like 
a Heidi Fleiss." (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was 
dropped off at her house without incident. 
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to speak with JS, a sixteen year-old female who was 
brought to Epstein's residence by Haley Robson. We met with JS's mother at their front door. We explained 
the ongoing investigation and asked to speak with JS as we had information that she had "worked" for Jeff. 
Mrs. S introduced us to her husband and allowed us entry into the home. We sat in the dining room and met 
with JS, Date of Birth 07-28-1988. As she was under the age of eighteen, Mrs S was advised we would be 
speaking with her. She expressed if her daughter had information, she wanted to assist. We interviewed JS, who 
denied having any inappropriate encounters with Jeff (Epstein). She stated she had gone to Jeff's house with 
Haley Robson approximately eight months ago and sat in the kitchen with the house chef, but nothing happened. 
As the parents were present during the interview, we felt that JS was withholding information from us. She made 
several comments as to putting the entire incident behind her. I left my telephone number and advised should she 
wish to speak with me again to telephone me. Sgt Frick and I thanked Mrs. S for her time and left the area. She 
stated she would ask JS again after we left as to what happened at Epstein's house. I informed her that JS had 
my telephone number and hopefully she would call.

during the female on female intercourse and provide oral sex to both AH and Marcinkova. This occurred during 
the time AH was sixteen years of age. 
AH advised this continued to escalate during two years. The routine became familiar to AH. Epstein's 
assistant Sarah would telephone her every time Epstein was in the Town of Palm Beach and would place 
appointments for her to visit and work for Epstein. Each time something new was introduced, additional monies 
were produced and offered for AH to allow the acts to happen. AH consented to perform all these acts but was 
adamant that there was an understanding with Epstein that no vaginal penetration would occur with his penis. AH 
explained that Epstein's penis was deformed. AH explained that his penis was oval shaped. AH claimed when 
Epstein's penis was erect, it was thick toward the bottom but was thin and small toward the head portion. AH 
called Epstein's penis "egg-shaped." AH stated Epstein would photograph Marcinkova and her naked and 
having sex and proudly display the photographs within the home. AH stated during one visit to Epstein's house 
in which she provided a massage to Epstein, his female friend, Nada Marcinkova, was also present. AH 
provided the massage in which Marcinkova and her would fondle each others breasts and kiss for Epstein to 
enjoy. Towards the end of this massage, Epstein grabbed AH and turned her over onto her stomach on the 
massage table and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. AH stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her 
vagina. AH became upset over this. She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as he continued 
to pump inside her. She screamed "No!" and Epstein stopped. She told him that she did not want to have his 
penis inside of her. Epstein did not ejaculate inside of her and apologized for his actions and subsequently paid 
her a thousand dollars for that visit. AH stated she knows he still displays her photographs through out the house.

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein's home located at 
358 El Brillo-Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master 
bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the 
master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked 
young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the 
house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a 
duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn 
on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers 
were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been 
interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other 
names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I 
have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. 
During the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein's 
bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside 
Epstein's bed that contained a bottle of "Joy Jelly," which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage 
tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein's 
bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located 
in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein's desk. A computer was located 
which was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer's hard drive was reviewed 
which showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these 
images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein's desk. 
On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob 02/29/1988. During a sworn taped 
statement, ML stated that when she was sixteen years old she was taken to Epstein's house to provide a massage 
for money. ML stated it was before Christmas last year (2004) when an associate, YL, approached her and 
asked if she needed to make money for Christmas. YL made arrangements to take ML to the house and drove 
ML to the house to "work." They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. ML was unable to 
remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein's assistant. She was led 
upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the 
lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and 
bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom. ML described the bathroom as a large 
spacious bathroom with a steam room and shower beside it. ML was introduced to Epstein who was on the 
phone when she entered the room. Epstein was wearing a white towel and laid on his stomach so that ML may

the small of his back. During the rubbing of his back, Epstein asked her to get comfortable. He requested she

panties. As she finished massaging the small of Epstein's back, he then turned onto his back. Epstein 
instructed ML to rub his chest and pinch his nipples. As she began to rub his chest, Epstein asked her questions 
about herself. ML remembered telling him she attended Royal Palm Beach High School. Epstein asked her if 
she was sexually active. Before ML could answer, he also asked what sexual position does she enjoy. ML 
stated she was shy and didn't like talking about those things. She continued rubbing his chest. Epstein reached 
up and unsnapped her bra from the front. ML explained the bra she used had a front snapping device. Epstein 
rubbed her breasts and asked her if she like having her breasts rubbed. ML said "no, I don't like that." Epstein 
then removed his towel and laid on the bed naked exposing his penis to ML. He began touching his penis and 
masturbated as he touched her breasts. ML explained Epstein then touched her vaginal area by rubbing her 
vagina with his fingers on the outside of her thong panties. ML tensed up and stated Epstein was aware that she 
was uncomfortable. ML stated that Epstein said to her, "Relax, I'm not going inside." She further explained 
Epstein commented to her how beautiful and sexy she was. Epstein then moved her thong panties to one side 
and began stroking her clitoris. ML said, "He commented how hard my clit was." He then inserted two fingers in 
her vagina and was stroking her within her vagina. She tried pulling back to pull out his fingers from within her 
vagina. Epstein removed his fingers from within her vagina and apologized for putting his fingers inside her. 
During this time, he kept his hand on her vaginal area and continued to rub her vagina. ML stated he rubbed her 
really hard as he was masturbating. ML said he climaxed onto the towel he had been previously wearing and got 
up from the table. Epstein told her there was $200.00 dollars for her on the dresser within the master bathroom. 
Epstein also told her that there was an additional $100.00 that was to be given to YL for bringing her there to 
massage him. Epstein told her to leave her telephone number with his assistant as he wanted to see her again. 
Epstein stated his assistant would contact her to work again soon. I asked her if she ever received any formal 
massage training to which ML stated she did not. ML stated it was the only time she ever went to work for Jeff 
and knew what happened to her was wrong. She further stated that she had never been contacted for any 
additional work. 
On January 9, 2006, I located and interviewed another victim, CL, dob 04/29/1988. CL was identified 
as a potential victim/witness from information obtained during trash pulls from Epstein's residence. CL stated she 
met Epstein when she was fifteen years of age. She was approached by a friend from Royal Palm Beach High 
School, Tatum Miller, to be taken to Jeffrey Epstein's house to work. She was originally told she would be able

to model lingerie for a wealthy Palm Beacher. CL was taken to Epstein's house located on El BrilloWay. Miller 
introduced CL to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had his personal chef prepare dinner for CL and Miller. At the 
conclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large 
massage table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a towel. Miller 
informed CL that they were going to provide a massage on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead 
of modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had 
told CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did 
not wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back. 
Epstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein 
began masturbating himself . Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein 
continued to masturbate himself as he stroked her vagina. Epstein ejaculated on his towel and paid CL $200.00 
for the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could 
happen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein's houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where 
she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for 
CL to return to "work." CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein's bedroom area by Sarah who 
prepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein had CL remove her 
clothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his 
back. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and 
downward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the 
other hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the towel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid 
$200.00 for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would 
happen. CL wanted to notify authorities however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her 
family. 
During the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim 
through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books retrieved 
from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age 
eighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same 
massage routine when they went to "work" for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and 
made appointments for the females to "work" for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein's house and were 
led upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein's bedroom. Epstein would then 
enter the room wearing only a towel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the 
massage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on

their vaginal area. He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The 
girls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage. 
On November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated 
he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he 
was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for 
Epstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private 
plane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein's home. Alessi stated Epstein 
receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards 
the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi 
stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's 
bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things 
going on other than a massage.. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he 
would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. 
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage. 
On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn 
taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from 
November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, 
chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about 
masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have 
one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated 
he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would 
meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen 
area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or 
Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses 
appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. 
He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for 
one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high 
school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. 
He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators 
and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them 
away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl 
he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the 
girl always needed rides to and from the house. 
Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary 
with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High School after AH high school drama 
performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and direction to extend the rental 
contract. 
During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records 
from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these 
records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims. 
These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they 
victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley 
Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated 
the encounters with AH, AD, 	
— .., 
 and 	 during the time frame the girls 
stated they occurred. 
Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein's private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation. 
The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein's plane at Palm Beach International airport. These 
records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen This comparison found that all the phone calls 
Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein 
was in Palm Beach. 
As Epstein, who at the time of the incident was fifty two years of age, did commit lewd and lascivious 
molestation on SG, a fourteen year old minor, by using a vibrator on her external vaginal area and as Haley 
Robson recruited, set up the appointment and drove to Epstein's residence, knowing that SG was fourteen years 
old and knowing there would be unlawful sexual activity between SG and Epstein that Robson received monetary 
compensation for taking said fourteen year old female by Epstein, there is sufficient probable cause to arrest 
Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Act on victim under 16 years of age in violation of Florida State Statue 800.04 
(6)(2b) a second degree felony.

during the female on female intercourse and provide oral sex to both AH and Marcinkova. This occurred during 
the time AH was sixteen years of age. 
AH advised this continued to escalate during two years. The routine became familiar to AH. Epstein's 
assistant Sarah would telephone her every time Epstein was in the Town of Palm Beach and would place 
appointments for her to visit and work for Epstein. Each time something new was introduced, additional monies 
were produced and offered for AH to allow the acts to happen. AH consented to perform all these acts but was 
adamant that there was an understanding with Epstein that no vaginal penetration would occur with his penis. AH 
explained that Epstein's penis was deformed. AH explained that his penis was oval shaped. AH claimed when 
Epstein's penis was erect, it was thick toward the bottom but was thin and small toward the head portion. AH 
called Epstein's penis "egg-shaped." AH stated Epstein would photograph Marcinkova and her naked and 
having sex and proudly display the photographs within the home. AH stated during one visit to Epstein's house 
in which she provided a massage to Epstein, his female friend, Nada Marcinkova, was also present. AH 
provided the massage in which Marcinkova and her would fondle each others breasts and kiss for Epstein to 
enjoy. Towards the end of this massage, Epstein grabbed AH and turned her over onto her stomach on the 
massage table and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. AH stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her 
vagina. AH became upset over this. She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as he continued 
to pump inside her. She screamed "No!" and Epstein stopped. She told him that she did not want to have his 
penis inside of her. Epstein did not ejaculate inside of her and apologized for his actions and subsequently paid 
her a thousand dollars for that visit. AH stated she knows he still displays her photographs through out the house.

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein's home located at 
358 El Brillo•Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master 
bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the 
master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked 
young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the 
house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a 
duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn 
on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers 
were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been 
interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other 
names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I 
have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. 
During the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein's 
bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside 
Epstein's bed that contained a bottle of "Joy Jelly," which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage 
tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein's 
bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located 
in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein's desk. A computer was located 
which was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer's hard drive was reviewed 
which showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these 
images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein's desk. 
On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob 02/29/1988. During a sworn taped 
statement, ML stated that when she was sixteen years old she was taken to Epstein's house to provide a massage 
for money. ML stated it was before Christmas last year (2004) when an associate, YL, approached her and 
asked if she needed to make money for Christmas. YL made arrangements to take ML to the house and drove 
ML to the house to "work." They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. ML was unable to 
remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein's assistant. She was led 
upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the 
lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and 
bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom. ML described the bathroom as a large 
spacious bathroom with a steam room and shower beside it. ML was introduced to Epstein who was on the 
phone when she entered the room. Epstein was wearing a white towel and laid on his stomach so that ML may

massage his feet and calves. ML started the massage with the oils Epstein chose and rubbed his feet and calves. 
Epstein got off the phone and requested she massage his back as well. ML began rubbing his back and got to 
the small of his back. During the rubbing of his back, Epstein asked her to get comfortable. He requested she 
remove her pants and shirt. ML removed her shirt and pulled her pants off. ML stayed in her bra and thong 
panties. As she finished massaging the small of Epstein's back, he then turned onto his back. Epstein 
instructed ML to rub his chest and pinch his nipples. As she began to rub his chest, Epstein asked her questions 
about herself. ML remembered telling him she attended Royal Palm Beach High School. Epstein asked her if 
she was sexually active. Before ML could answer, he also asked what sexual position does she enjoy. ML 
stated she was shy and didn't like talking about those things. She continued rubbing his chest. Epstein reached 
up and unsnapped her bra from the front. ML explained the bra she used had a front snapping device. Epstein 
rubbed her breasts and asked her if she like having her breasts rubbed. ML said "no, I don't like that." Epstein 
then removed his towel and laid on the bed naked exposing his penis to ML. He began touching his penis and 
masturbated as he touched her breasts. ML explained Epstein then touched her vaginal area by rubbing her 
vagina with his fingers on the outside of her thong panties. ML tensed up and stated Epstein was aware that she 
was uncomfortable. ML stated that Epstein said to her, "Relax, I'm not going inside." She further explained 
Epstein commented to her how beautiful and sexy she was. Epstein then moved her thong panties to one side 
and began stroking her clitoris. ML said, "He commented how hard my clit was." He then inserted two fingers in 
her vagina and was stroking her within her vagina. She tried pulling back to pull out his fingers from within her 
vagina. Epstein removed his fingers from within her vagina and apologized for putting his fingers inside her. 
During this time, he kept his hand on her vaginal area and continued to rub her vagina. ML stated he rubbed her 
really hard as he was masturbating. ML said he climaxed onto the towel he had been previously wearing and got 
up from the table. Epstein told her there was $200.00 dollars for her on the dresser within the master bathroom. 
Epstein also told her that there was an additional $100.00 that was to be given to YL for bringing her there to 
massage him. Epstein told her to leave her telephone number with his assistant as he wanted to see her again. 
Epstein stated his assistant would contact her to work again soon. I asked her if she ever received any formal 
massage training to which ML stated she did not. ML stated it was the only time she ever went to work for Jeff 
and knew what happened to her was wrong. She further stated that she had never been contacted for any 
additional work. 
On January 9, 2006, I located and interviewed another victim, CL, dob 04/29/1988. CL was identified 
as a potential victim/witness from information obtained during trash pulls from Epstein's residence. CL stated she 
met Epstein when she was fifteen years of age. She was approached by a friend from Royal Palm Beach High 
School, Tatum Miller, to be taken to Jeffrey Epstein's house to work. She was originally told she would be able

to model lingerie for a wealthy Palm Beacher. CL was taken to Epstein's house located on El BrilloWay. Miller 
introduced CL to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had his personal chef prepare dinner for CL and Miller. At the 
conclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large 
massage table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a towel. Miller 
informed CL that they were going to provide a massage on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead 
of modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had 
told CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did 
not wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back. 
Epstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein 
began masturbating himself . Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein 
continued to masturbate himself as he stroked her vagina. Epstein ejaculated on his towel and paid CL $200.00 
for the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could 
happen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein's houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where 
she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for 
CL to return to "work." CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein's bedroom area by Sarah who 
prepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein had CL remove her 
clothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his 
back. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fmgers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and 
downward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the 
other hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the towel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid 
$200.00 for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would 
happen. CL wanted to notify authorities however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her 
family. 
During the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim 
through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books retrieved 
from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age 
eighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same 
massage routine when they went to "work" for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and 
made appointments for the females to "work" for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein's house and were 
led upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein's bedroom. Epstein would then 
enter the room wearing only a towel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the 
massage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on

their vaginal area. He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The 
girls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage. 
On November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated 
he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he 
was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for 
Epstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private 
plane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein's home. Alessi stated Epstein 
receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards 
the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi 
stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's 
bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things 
going on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he 
would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. 
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage. 
On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn 
taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from 
November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, 
chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about 
masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have 
one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated 
he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would 
meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen 
area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or 
Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses 
appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. 
He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for 
one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high 
school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. 
He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators 
and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them 
away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl 
he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the 
girl always needed rides to and from the house. 
Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary 
with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High School after AH high school drama 
performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and direction to extend the rental 
contract. 
During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records 
from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these 
records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims. 
These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they 
victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley 
Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated 
the encounters with AH, AD, 	 ., 
Beale ane 	 during the time frame the girls 
stated they occurred. 
Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein's private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation. 
The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein's plane at Palm Beach International airport. These 
records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen This comparison found that all the phone calls 
Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein 
was in Palm Beach. 
Therefore, as Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time of these incidents was fifty one years of age, did have 
vaginal intercourse either with his penis or digitally with AH, ML, CL and 	
, who were minors at the time this 
occurred, there is sufficient probable cause to charge Jeffrey Epstein with four counts of Unlawful Sexual Activity 
with a Minor, in violation of Florida State Statute 794.05(1), a second degree felony. As Epstein, who at the time 
of the incident was fifty two years of age, did use a vibrator on the external vaginal area of SG, a fourteen year 
old minor, there is sufficient probable cause to charge him with Lewd and Lascivious Molestation, in violation of 
Florida State Statute 800.04 (5), a second degree felony.

From March 15, 2005, through February 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department conducted a sexual 
battery investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. Sworn taped statements were 
taken from five victims and seventeen witnesses concerning massages and unlawful sexual activity that took place 
at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach. Several of the victims were recruited by and 
brought to the residence by Haley Robson to perform massages for Epstein, for which Robson received 
monetary compensation. During the visit they would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who in 
turn would record their telephone numbers and name. The victims would be brought to Epstein's bedroom to 
provide the massage. Epstein would enter the room and order the victims to remove their clothing to provide the 
massage. As the victims complied and provided the massages, Epstein would rub his fingers on their vaginas. 
On occasion, Epstein would introduce a massager/vibrator and rub the victims vaginas as they provided the 
massage. On three separate occasions, Epstein had intercourse and inserted his penis/fingers in the victims 
vaginas. At the conclusion of the massages the victims were paid sums of money ranging from $200 - $1,000. 
The facts, as reported, are as follows: 
On 03/15/2005, A fourteen year old white female, hereinafter referred to as "SG," dob 05/13/1990, and 
her family reported unlawful sexual activity which occurred at a residence within the Town of Palm Beach. SG 
reported that a subject known to her as "Jeff' had touched her vaginal area with a vibrator/massager while within 
his residence. "Jeff' was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up. 
During a sworn taped interview, SG stated that Haley Robson, dob 04/09/1986, a cousin of SG's 
boyfriend and classmate at Royal Palm Beach High School, worked for a wealthy man and did sexual favors for 
him. She also admitted that Robson had offered her an opportunity to make money. During the beginning of

conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age, 
she should say she was eighteen. It was later confirmed by the SG's.father that Robson picked his daughter up 
on February 6, 2005. According to SG's father, Robson drove a pick up truck. 
SG described Epstein's house as a two-story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the 
driveway. She recalled that Jeffs house was on a dead end street. Upon arriving at the house SG stated that 
they walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. A male approaching them 
asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Epstein. The male allowed them to continue 
walking up to the house. SG stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He 
allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. 
Shortly thereafter, Epstein and his assistant, described as white female with blond hair and later identified as 
Sarah Kellen, entered the kitchen. Epstein introduced himself to SG. SG described Epstein as being 
approximately forty-five years old, having a long face and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair. 
Robson and Epstein left the kitchen leaving SG alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. 
They all spoke briefly in the kitchen. SG was instructed to follow Kellen upstairs. SG recalled walking up a 
flight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room that had a massage table in it. Upon entering the room there 
was a large bathroom to the right and a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door on each side of 
the sofa. SG recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several photographs of 
naked women on a shelf. Kellen told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second. 
Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel and told SG to take off her clothes. SG stated Epstein 
was stem when he told her to take off her clothes. SG said she did not know what to do as she was the only one 
there in the room so she took off her shirt leaving her bra on. Epstein had removed his towel and told the SG to 
take off everything. SG stated Epstein was nude when he took his towel off, placing it on the floor as he laid 
down on the table. SG stated she then removed her pants leaving her thong panties on. Epstein then instructed 
her to give him a massage pointing to a specific lotion for her to use. As SG began to give Epstein the massage, 
he told her to get on his back. SG stated she straddled herself on Epstein's back whereby her exposed buttocks 
were touching Epstein's bare buttocks. SG said Epstein was specific in his instruction to her on how to massage 
him, telling her to go clockwise or counter clockwise. Epstein then turned over and instructed SG to massage his 
chest. SG was now standing on the ground and resumed massaging Epstein's chest area. SG stated Epstein held 
onto the small of her back as she massaged his chest and shoulder area. Epstein then turned to his side and 
started to rub his penis in an up and down motion. Epstein then pulled out a purple vibrator and began to

SG recalled Epstein ejaculating because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Epstein 
then left the room and SG got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. SG said she 
was paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone 
number. As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred 
dollars that day for bringing her. 
During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the 
investigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson's cellular telephone 561-
308-0282. SG spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson, 
what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, "the more you do, the more you get paid." 
Robson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an 
appointment for SG to go to Epstein's house at 11:00 am on April 5, 2005. This message was recorded from 
SG's voice mail. 
Based on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein's residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of 
the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2005 revealed a telephone 
message for Epstein which stated Haley and SG's name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had 
informed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein's house. 
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson's residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the 
driveway, a red Dodge Neon. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was 
told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach. Robson was 
asked if she would accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the 
conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. Robson voluntarily came with us back to the Palm 
Beach Police Department. 
Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau 
where I obtained a taped, sworn statement. I began the interview by asking Robson how she became 
acquainted with Epstein. Robson stated that approximately two years ago, just after she turned 17 years of age, 
she was approached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked 
if she wanted to make money. She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. 
Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.

Epstein's house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She 
was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known 
to her as Jeff Epstein's bedroom. Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She 
brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sarah, then left the room and informed 
Robson Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel 
and laid nude on the massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson 
to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated "He tried to touch me and I stopped him." I asked how he 
tried to touch her. Robson stated that Epstein grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson told 
Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At 
the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200. 
After the massage Epstein stated to Robson that he understood she was not comfortable, but he would 
pay her if she brought over some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to bring 
a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson stated that in total she only

through 16 years of age. I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised SG was the youngest as 
she was fourteen when the massage occurred. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when 
they arrived. They were told they would provide a massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked 
her if SG was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew that SG 
wanted to make money. She approached SG and explained about going to work for Jeff, SG agreed and

when he was going to travel to Palm Beach. Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that 
he is traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to "work" for Epstein. Robson 
stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters with him 
and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sarah still tries to call Robson's house and leaves messages. 
Sgt Frick entered the room and explained to Robson that based on her own statements, she had 
implicated herself by bringing underage girls to Epstein's house. Robson provided cellular telephone numbers for 
the girls she had mentioned previously. Additionally, she also provided possible addresses and areas in which 
they lived. 
As Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record 
any conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment " I'm like 
a Heidi Fleiss." (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was 
dropped off at her house without incident. 
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to speak with JS, a sixteen year-old female who was 
brought to Epstein's residence by Haley Robson. We met with JS's mother at their front door. We explained 
the ongoing investigation and asked to speak with JS as we had information that she had "worked" for Jeff. 
Mrs. S introduced us to her husband and allowed us entry into the home. We sat in the dining room and met 
with JS, Date of Birth 07-28-1988. As she was under the age of eighteen, Mrs S was advised we would be 
speaking with her. She expressed if her daughter had information, she wanted to assist. We interviewed JS, who 
denied having any inappropriate encounters with Jeff (Epstein). She stated she had gone to Jeff's house with 
Haley Robson approximately eight months ago and sat in the kitchen with the house chef, but nothing happened. 
As the parents were present during the interview, we felt that JS was withholding information from us. She made 
several comments as to putting the entire incident behind her. I left my telephone number and advised should she 
wish to speak with me again to telephone me. Sgt Frick and I thanked Mrs. S for her time and left the area. She 
stated she would ask JS again after we left as to what happened at Epstein's house. I informed her that JS had 
my telephone number and hopefully she would call.

during the female on female intercourse and provide oral sex to both AH and Marcinkova. This occurred during 
the time AH was sixteen years of age. 
AH advised this continued to escalate during two years. The routine became familiar to AH. Epstein's 
assistant Sarah would telephone her every time Epstein was in the Town of Palm Beach and would place 
appointments for her to visit and work for Epstein. Each time something new was introduced, additional monies 
were produced and offered for AH to allow the acts to happen. AH consented to perform all these acts but was 
adamant that there was an understanding with Epstein that no vaginal penetration would occur with his penis. AH 
explained that Epstein's penis was deformed. AH explained that his penis was oval shaped. AH claimed when 
Epstein's penis was erect, it was thick toward the bottom but was thin and small toward the head portion. AH 
called Epstein's penis "egg-shaped." AH stated Epstein would photograph Marcinkova and her naked and 
having sex and proudly display the photographs within the home. AH stated during one visit to Epstein's house 
in which she provided a massage to Epstein, his female friend, Nada Marcinkova, was also present. AH 
provided the massage in which Marcinkova and her would fondle each others breasts and kiss for Epstein to 
enjoy. Towards the end of this massage, Epstein grabbed AH and turned her over onto her stomach on the 
massage table and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. AH stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her 
vagina. AH became upset over this. She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as he continued 
to pump inside her. She screamed "No!" and Epstein stopped. She told him that she did not want to have his 
penis inside of her. Epstein did not ejaculate inside of her and apologized for his actions and subsequently paid 
her a thousand dollars for that visit. AH stated she knows he still displays her photographs through out the house.
