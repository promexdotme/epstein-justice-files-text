creating any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of any such series shall have no voting power
whatsoever.
FIFTH      The by-laws may be made, altered, amended or repealed by the Board of Directors. The books of the
Corporation (subject to the provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware) may be kept outside of the State of
Delaware at such places as from time to time may be designated by the Board of Directors.
SIXTH      (1)  To the fullest extent that the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it exists on the
date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors,
no director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.
(2)    The Corporation shall have the power to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or any other person who is serving at the request of the Corporation in any such
capacity with another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including,
without limitation, any employee benefit plan) to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be
amended, and any such indemnification may continue as to any person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and may inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.
(3)    By action of its Board of Directors, notwithstanding any interest of the directors in the action,
the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, in such amounts as the Board of Directors
deems appropriate, to protect any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or any
other person who is serving at the request of the Corporation in any such capacity with another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including, without limitation, any
employee benefit plan) against any liability asserted against him or incurred by him in any such
capacity or arising out of his status as such (including, without limitation, expenses, judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement) to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended, and
whether or not the Corporation would have the power or would be required to indemnify any such
person under the terms of any agreement or by-law or the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware. For purposes of this paragraph (3), "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to any employee benefit plan.
SEVENTH       (1)    Any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of Common Stock of the
Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation
and may not be effected by any consent in writing.
(2)    Whenever the vote of holders of shares of any class or series other than Common Stock at a
meeting thereof is required or permitted to be taken for or in connection with any corporate action
by any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the meeting and vote of
such stockholders may be dispensed with if such action is taken with the written consent of such
holders representing not less than a majority of the voting power of all the capital stock of such
class or series entitled to be voted upon such action if a meeting were held; provided that in no case
shall the written consent be by such holders having less than the minimum percentage of the vote
required by statute for such action, and provided that prompt notice is given in writing to all such
stockholders entitled to vote thereon of the taking of corporate action without a meeting and by less
than unanimous written consent.
(3)    Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws so provide.
EIGHTH      The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this
Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
