UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
 FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
 
 
United States of America 
 
 
v. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Case No. 20-mj-132-AJ-1 
 
Ghislaine Maxwell 
 
Public Access Findings 
I. 
Background 
This hearing is taking place during the public health 
emergency caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.  All parties to this 
proceeding, including the court, are appearing remotely via 
video.  In light of the anticipated volume of public and media 
interest and the operational/capacity limitations of 
videoconference technology, public and media access to the 
proceeding will be via telephonic conference.  The court’s 
protocols for this hearing are laid out in Standing Order 20-7 
(Mar. 23, 2020).1  The court finds that conducting this hearing 
via video — under the unique circumstances presented by the 
COVID-19 pandemic — is the best way to ensure the safety of the 
litigants, court personnel, and the public at large.  All 
findings made in the court’s prior standing orders are

Standing Order 20-21 (June 17, 2020).

incorporated herein.  See Standing Orders 20-5 (Mar. 20, 2020) 
and 20-21 (June 17, 2020).2 
The hearing held today will be an initial appearance and 
removal hearing for defendant Ghislaine Maxwell.  Today’s 
hearing has been noticed as a video hearing.  In the event 
defendant consents to proceed, the court makes the findings 
below.   
Before convening this video/telephone hearing, the court 
carefully considered the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to 
public court proceedings and the public’s and press’s First 
Amendment rights to in-person access to such proceedings.  See 
Bucci v. United States, 662 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing 
Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39, 48 (1984)); Press-Enter. Co. v. 
Superior Court of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 501, 509-
10 (1984).  This Order details my findings. 
II. 
Partial Rather Than Total Closure 
The court first finds that this video hearing constitutes a 
partial, rather than total, closure of these proceedings.  The 
court so finds because the goals of public access will still be 
achieved: this proceeding is not being held in secret and the 
public, including members of the press, maintains the

opportunity to access this proceeding in real time.  See 
Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 593-97 
(1980) (Brennan, J., concurring) (discussing the functions of 
public access to court proceedings, including ensuring that 
procedural rights are respected and that justice is afforded 
equally, maintaining public confidence in the administration of 
justice, promoting accurate fact-finding, and enabling the 
public to act as a check on judicial power); see also Bucci, 662 
F.3d at 22 (discussing benefits of openness in criminal 
proceedings).  Under the extraordinary circumstances presented 
by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the court finds this 
partial closure is necessary. 
III. Findings in Support of Necessity for this Partial Closure  
A. First, the court finds that protecting the health and 
safety of the public and the parties to this proceeding 
from the spread of COVID-19 is a substantial interest that 
would be jeopardized and prejudiced if the court did not 
impose this partial closure.  
Since the first announced case in New Hampshire on March 2, 
2020, the state has reported 5,802 confirmed cases of COVID-19.3  
So far, 373 deaths have been attributed to the disease in this

state.  Further, in New Hampshire approximately 3,475 people are 
being monitored for signs of COVID-19 infection, over 120,307 
total tests have been reported (both positive and negative test 
results), and community-based transmission has been confirmed.4  
Nationally, the number of confirmed cases has grown to over 
2,797,737, with 130,984 cases resulting in death.5  
Given the contagious nature of the virus and the 
exponential growth in cases, COVID-19 presents an enormous 
danger to the health and safety of the public, including the 
litigants, security, and court personnel involved in this 
proceeding.  The court’s interest in preventing the spread of 
COVID-19 and preserving the health of all hearing participants, 
including the public, is a weighty and substantial interest that 
would likely be prejudiced if the court were not to impose this 
partial closure.  See United States v. Smith, 426 F.3d 567, 572-
73 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding that U.S. Marshal’s policy after 
September 11th of requiring unknown visitors to court to produce 
photo identification constituted partial closure of courtroom

that was justified by substantial interest of promoting security 
and preventing terrorism). 
B. Second, the court finds that this partial closure of court 
proceedings is narrowly tailored to protect public health 
and safety and is less restrictive than the court’s current 
in-court hearing protocols. 
 Allowing the public to access these proceedings through 
telephone conference allows a large number (up to 500) of 
members of the public to access the proceedings while, at the 
same time, protecting the health of all involved by limiting the 
potential exposure of the public, parties, and court staff to 
COVID-19.  
Importantly, the court finds that, in light of the court’s 
current restrictions on the number of people permitted in the 
courtroom, providing public telephonic access is less 
restrictive than holding an in-person hearing which only a 
limited number of people can attend.  Further, via telephone, 
even individuals who would have otherwise been prohibited from 
entering the courthouse — for example, people who have tested 
positive for COVID-19 — now have access (even though virtual) to 
the proceedings.  See Standing Order 20-9 (Mar. 20, 2020) 
(prohibiting certain individuals from entering the courthouse, 
including people diagnosed with or exposed to someone diagnosed 
with COVID-19).  Providing the public access to this proceeding 
via telephone is the least restrictive means of protecting the

substantial interest of public health and safety.  See United 
States v. Alimehmeti, 284 F. Supp. 3d 477, 490 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) 
(granting partial closure of courtroom to protect identity of 
undercover agents: courtroom was closed to public during 
undercover agents’ testimony but audio of testimony was live-
streamed into different courtroom during partial closure and 
transcripts of testimony were made available to public 
promptly). 
C. Third, the court has considered reasonable alternatives to 
this partial closure.  
The court has considered alternatives to this partial 
closure and finds they are neither reasonable nor feasible under 
the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and this case, 
particularly the necessity that this hearing be conducted 
promptly.   
IV. 
Conclusion 
In sum, the court finds that in this case a partial closure 
of court proceedings is necessary in that today’s hearing will 
be conducted by video and telephone conference.  This partial 
closure is justified by the substantial interest of protecting 
public health and safety from the spread of COVID-19 and is 
narrowly tailored to protect that interest.  The public 
maintains the opportunity to access these proceedings in full by 
telephone.
