ORDER 
 
 
 
PAUL A. ENGELMAYER, District Judge:  
 
 
On December 23, 2019, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Under Rule 15(a)(1)(B), a plaintiff has 21 days after the 
service of a motion under Rule 12(b) to amend the complaint once as a matter of course. 
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that plaintiff shall file any amended complaint by 
January 13, 2020.  No further opportunities to amend will ordinarily be granted.  If plaintiff does 
amend, by February 3, 2020, defendants shall: (1) file an answer; (2) file a new motion to 
dismiss; or (3) submit a letter to the Court, copying plaintiff, stating that they rely on the 
previously filed motion to dismiss.1 
It is further ORDERED that if no amended complaint is filed, plaintiff shall serve any 
opposition to the motion to dismiss by January 13, 2020.  Defendants’ reply, if any, shall be 
served by January 27, 2020.  At the time any reply is served, the moving party shall supply the 
Court with two (2) courtesy copies of all motion papers by mailing or delivering them to the 
Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 40 Centre Street, New York, New York 10007. 
                                                 
1 If defendants file a new motion to dismiss or rely on their previous motion, plaintiff’s 
opposition will be due 14 days thereafter, and defendants’ reply, if any, will be due seven days 
after that.
