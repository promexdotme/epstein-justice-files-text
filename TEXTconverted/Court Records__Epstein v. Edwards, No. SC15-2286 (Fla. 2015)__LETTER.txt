DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA 
FOURTH DISTRICT 
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS, 
Appellant, 
v. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN and SCOTT ROTHSTEIN, 
Appellees. 
No. 4D14-2282 
[November 12, 2015] 
Appeal from the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm 
Beach 
County; 
Donald 
W. 
Hafele, 
Judge; 
L.T. 
Case 
No. 
502009CA040800XXXXMB. 
Philip M. Burlington of Burlington & Rockenbach, P.A., and William B. 
King of Searcy Denney Scarola Barnhart & Shipley, P.A., West Palm Beach, 
for appellant. 
Paul Morris of The Law Offices of Paul Morris, P.A., Miami, and Tonja 
Haddad Coleman of Tonja Haddad, PA, Fort Lauderdale, for appellee 
Jeffrey Epstein. 
WARNER,J. 
Appellant challenges a summary judgment holding that his malicious 
prosecution claim against appellee Epstein was barred by the litigation 
privilege. The trial court granted summary judgment based upon Wolfe v. 
Foreman, 128 So. 3d 67 (Fla. 3d DCA 2013), which had decided this issue 
just before the motion for summary judgment was heard. 1 However, after 
the trial court ruled, our court held to the contrary in Fischer v. Debrincat, 
169 So. 3d 1204, 1209 (Fla. 4th DCA 2015), and certified conflict with 
Wolfe to the supreme court. See also Rivemider v. Meyer, 174 So. 3d 602, 
604 (Fla. 4th DCA 2015) (same). As the issue is the same in this case, we 
hold that the litigation privilege does not bar a malicious prosecution 
1 The trial court properly relied on Wolfe at the time, because that case was 
binding upon the trial court in the absence of interdistrict conflict. See Pardo v. 
State, 596 So. 2d 665, 666 (Fla. 1992). 

cause of action where all the elements of malicious prosecution are 
present. 
Epstein suggests that this case could be decided on a tipsy coachman 
analysis, as he alleges that all the elements of the cause of action were not 
present. However, the trial court specifically found that material issues of 
fact remained as to the elements of the claim. Based upon the facts 
presented and the inferences which may be drawn from those facts, we 
will not disturb the trial court's evaluation. 
Just as in Fi.scher and Rivemider, we certify that this opinion conflicts 
with Wolfe. 
Reversed and remanded for furlher proceedings. 
TAYLOR and FORST, JJ., concur.
