UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America 
v. 
Michael Thomas, 
Defendant. 
Deferred Prosecution Agreement 
19 Cr. 830 (AT) 
TO: 
MICHAEL THOMAS 
On November 19, 2019, a grand jury sitting in this District returned a six-count indictment
(the “Indictment”), which charged Michael Thomas (“you”) with committing offenses against the 
United States, to wit, conspiring to knowingly defraud the United States and to knowingly make 
and use a false writing or document, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and three counts of knowingly 
making and using a false writing or document, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.  However, after a 
thorough investigation, and based on the facts of this case and your personal circumstances, the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”) has determined 
that the interests of justice will best be served by deferring prosecution in this District.  Upon your 
acceptance of responsibility for your behavior and by your signature on this deferred prosecution 
agreement (the “Agreement”), prosecution will be deferred during the term of your behavior and 
satisfactory compliance with the terms of this Agreement for the period of six months from the 
date of this Agreement.   
The terms and conditions constituting your good behavior and satisfactory compliance are 
as follows: 
(1)
You shall refrain from violating any federal, state, or local law.  You shall immediately
contact your U.S. Pretrial Services Officer if arrested or questioned by a law-
enforcement officer.
(2)
You shall associate only with law-abiding persons.
(3)
You shall work regularly at a lawful occupation, regularly attend school, and/or support
or care for your legal dependents, if any, to the best of your ability, as approved by your
U.S. Pretrial Services Officer.  You shall notify your supervising U.S. Pretrial Services
Officer prior to any work or school changes.
(4)
You shall not leave the contiguous United States without permission of your
supervising U.S. Pretrial Services Officer.  In accordance with this condition, the U.S.
Pretrial Services Office shall return your passport upon the Court’s entering this
Agreement, and shall do so indefinitely unless this Agreement is violated.

(5) 
You shall notify your supervising U.S. Pretrial Services Officer immediately of any 
change in your place of residence. 
 
(6) 
You shall follow your supervising U.S. Pretrial Services Officer’s instructions and 
advice. 
 
(7) 
You shall report to your supervising U.S. Pretrial Services Officer as directed. 
 
 
 
As a further condition you hereby consent to disclosure, by any federal, state, or local 
government agency, or by any medical or substance abuse treatment provider, to the U.S. Pretrial 
Services Officer supervising your case, of such medical and treatment records as may be requested 
by the Pretrial Services Officer to evaluate deferral of prosecution in this case.  You further agree 
that you will execute any additional consent forms that any such agency or provider may require 
to release such information. 
 
Special conditions are as follows: 
 
You shall truthfully and completely disclose all information with respect to the activities 
of yourself and others related to your employment by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), which 
information can be used for any purpose.  You shall agree to meet with and be interviewed by the 
USAO-SDNY, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, Office of the 
Inspector General (“DOJ-OIG”), and any other law enforcement agency designated by this Office. 
 
You shall complete 100 documented hours of community service, preferably related to the 
criminal justice system, including working with recently released inmates.  The specific type of 
community service to be performed must be approved by your Pretrial Services Officer. 
 
The USAO-SDNY may at any time revoke or modify any condition of this provisional 
release or change the period of such supervision, which shall in no case exceed six months.  The 
USAO-SDNY may discharge you from supervision at any time.  The USAO-SDNY may at any 
time proceed with the prosecution for this offense should the USAO-SDNY, in its sole discretion, 
deem such action advisable. 
 
 
 
If upon completion of your supervision a written report from your supervising U.S. Pretrial 
Services Officer is received to the effect that you have complied with all the rules, regulations and 
conditions and special conditions applicable to your deferred prosecution, no further prosecution 
will be instituted in this District for the above offenses. 
 
 
 
Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to preclude the BOP or the DOJ-OIG from 
taking any administrative action against you, including suspension or termination of employment, 
based on the facts alleged in the Indictment, the facts identified in the course of the investigation 
that led to the Indictment, or your own statements to the DOJ-OIG or any other law enforcement 
entity.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to require the BOP or the DOJ-OIG to delay 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 56     Filed 05/25/21     Page 2 of 5

any administrative action until after the expiration of the period of deferment contemplated by this 
Agreement.  You agree that a copy of this Agreement, including your admission and acceptance 
of responsibility, shall be provided to the BOP.   
 
*

If you successfully complete the term of supervision and fulfills all the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, the Government will move the Court to dismiss the Indictment as to 
the defendant. 
 
 
 
It is further understood that this Agreement and the terms and conditions set forth herein 
are limited to the facts and circumstances of this case and lack precedential value.
