A 
Additional subpoenas that have been issued 
2 
include OLY-28 to Colonial Bank, along with OLY-29, which 
3 
was issued to Palm Beach National Bank & Trust Company. 
4 
That was served on march 5, 2007. It should be known that 
5 
Palm Beach National Bank & Trust Company is now operated 
6 
by Colonial Bank, which we learned in the issuance 
7 
process. We did receive documents back from Colonial 
8 
Bank, which covered both subpoenas, on April 25, 2007.

And those sought information relating to bank 
10 
accounts belonging to Mr. Epstein?

A 
That is correct.

Also served OLY-30 to Western Union Financial

Services seeking documents and records related to Jeffrey 
15 
Epstein. It was served on February 26, 2007, and we

Q 
The same type of information? 
3 
A 
Yes, the same type of information, seeking wire

transfer information from Jeffrey Epstein to victims.

We also served 0LY-32 to J.P. Morgan Chase Bank. 
6 
After serving that one on February 26, 2007, they informed 
7 
us by letter that they are known as Chase, not J.P. Morgan 
8 
Chase. So we had to reissue another subpoena, which was 
9 
taken care of on March 22, '07. 
10 
We also issued 0LY-40 on Chase Bank as well on 
11 
12 
April 4, 2007. We received records on April 13, 2007 and 
April 19, 2007 to cover all three subpoenas that were 
13 
served.

15 
accounts and credit cards related to the defendants? 
16 
A 
Yes. Additionally, we served OLY-33 on Dr. 
17 
Thomas Rofranno (phonetic), who's a chiropractic doctor. 
18 
We were seeking records related to Jeffrey Epstein as a 
19 
patient. The subpoena was served on March 6, 2007, and 
20 
Thomas Rofranno provided materials on March 16. 2007. 
21 
Also we have OLY-36, which was served on the 
22 
Palm Beach County Health Department. it was served on 
23 
March 5, 2007, seeking birth certificates of our victims 
24 
that we were researching. We received the records from 
25 
the Palm Beach County Health Department on April 16, 2007.

We also served two subpoenas on the Adult Video 
Warehouse. The first one was OLY-41, which was served --
both of these were served on April 24, 2007, and they were 
seeking any transactions that had occurred on behalf of 
Mr. Epstein or those individuals that were working for him 
or with him. We received items back on the OLY-41 
subpoena on April 30, 2007. 
The second subpoena served on Adult Video 
Warehouse was OLY-34. Again, it was served on April 24, 
2007, and the Adult Video Warehouse complied and provided 
us materials on April 30, 2007. 
That concludes all of the items that we have 
received to date for the outstanding subpoenas that were 
issued. 
Q 
Are the documents that you refer to in that box 
that's on the desk? 
A 
Yes, they are. 
: Does anyone want to review those 
documents? At this time, no one is requesting that 
they want to review the documents today. 
Would you please swear in the witness to 
maintain those documents. 
(Witness sworn in as custodian of the 
records.) 
(Witness excused.)
