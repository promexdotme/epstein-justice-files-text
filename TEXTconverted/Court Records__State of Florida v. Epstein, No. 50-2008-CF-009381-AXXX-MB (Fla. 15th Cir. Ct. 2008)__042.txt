MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Anyone claiming an interest in pending litigation may at any time be permitted to assert a 
right by intervention, but the intervention shall be in subordination to, and in recognition of, the 
propriety of the main proceeding, unless otherwise ordered by the court in its discretion. 
Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.230. "A person seeking leave to intervene must claim an interest of such a direct 
and immediate character that the intervenor will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation 
and effect of the judgment." Litvak v. Scylla Properties, LLC, 946 So.2d 1165, 1172 (Fla. 5th 
DCA 2006). Additionally, "an intervenor my not inject a new issue into the case." 
Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida, Inc., v. IMC Phosphates, Inc., 857 So.2d 
207, 211 (Fla. I st DCA 2003). "An intervention is thus only appropriate where the issue the 
intervenor raises are related to the case being litigated." Racing Properties, L.P., v. Baldwin, 885 
So.2d 881,883 (Fla. 3rd DCA 2004). 
Once the trial court determines that the intervenor's interest is sufficient, it exercises its 
discretion to determine whether to permit intervention. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co. v. Carlisle, 593 
So.2d 505, 507 (Fla. 1992). "In deciding this question the court should consider a number of 
factors, including the derivation of the interest, any pertinent contractual language, the size of the 
interest, the potential for conflicts or new issues, and any other relevant circumstance." Id. 
Finally, an intervention is generally considered timely if it is made before a final decree has been 
entered. See Technical Chemicals And Products, Inc., v. Porchester Holdings, Inc., 748 So.2d 
1090, 1091 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000).

Applicant's proposed intervention is subordinate and in recognition of the propriety of 
the main proceeding. Additionally, Applicant will not inject any new issue into Mr. Epstein's 
criminal case. In fact, Applicant's intervention is for the limited purpose of joining already 
intervening parties._,, and "the Palm Beach Post" in their arguments regarding the sealed 
Federal non-prosecution agreement in Mr. Epstein's criminal file. Finally, Applicant's interest is 
of such a direct and immediate character that the Applicant stands to either gain or lose by the 
court's judgment in the pending matter. The Applicant currently has a civil complaint against 
Mr. Epstien regarding allegations similar to those in this pending criminal mater. The sealed 
document may contain discoverable information or may lead to the discovery of new relevant 
informatiop.. See Fla.R.Civ.P. l.280(b)(l). Additionally, the document may contain valuable 
impeachment information that the Applicant would intend to use if the Applicant's civil case 
proceeded to trial. 
WHEREFORE, Applicant, 1111 respectfully requests the Court grant-motion to 
intervene in the pending criminal matter.
