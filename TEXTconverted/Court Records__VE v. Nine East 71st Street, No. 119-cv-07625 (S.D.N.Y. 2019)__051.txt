Dear Judge Freeman: 
 
We represent the five Plaintiffs referenced above whose cases have all been assigned to Your Honor. While 
we agree with Defendants’ assertion that our discussions with the designers and administrator of the Epstein 
Victims’ Compensation Program have been positive and productive, in our view, it remains important to 
every aspect of the process that our cases are not stayed and that they proceed accordingly.   
 
As we explained during the Case Management Conference that was held on November 21, 2019, our clients 
have varying views of the process, and while each will maintain an open mind about potential alternative 
resolution, those who have filed lawsuits do not wish to delay the expeditious litigation of their claims. 
 
We have and will continue to work with Mr. Moskowitz to ensure that we arrive at as many agreements as 
possible.  Consequently, we agree with the following discovery schedule as proposed in his report: Plaintiffs 
and the Estate will make initial disclosures by January 23, 2020; the Parties will exchange proposed 
discovery plans by January 30, 2020; and the Parties will jointly submit to Your Honor a proposed discovery 
plan by February 6, 2020. 
 
Respectfully Submitted,  
 
 
 
Bradley J. Edwards
