L.M., 
V. 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 09-CIV-81092- MARRNJOHNSON 
Plaintiff, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendants. 
I 
EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO DISMISS COMPLAINT 
AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein") pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), moves to 
dismiss the Complaint (DE #1) filed by Plaintiff, L.M. due to her failure to serve the Complaint 
on Epstein within the time specified in Rule 4(m), and states: 
I. 
On July 24, 2009, L.M. filed a two hundred thirty-four (234) page, one hundred 
fifty-six (156) count Complaint (DE#!) against Epstein. 
2. 
Each of the one hundred fifty-six (I 56) counts is a separate cause of action pursuant 
to 18 U.S.C. §2255. 
3. 
The Complaint was filed by Bradley J. Edwards while he was employed by the now 
defunct Rothstein, Rosenfeldt & Adler firm. 
4. 
However, this Complaint served no legal purpose whatsoever in that at the time the 
Complaint was filed LM had a pending state court action (which is still currently pending) seeking 
damages under theories other than the exclusive remedies in 18 U.S.C. §2255. See L.M. v. Jeffrey 
Epstein, Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMB in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm 
Beach County, Florida.

5. 
This Complaint was never served on Epstein within the time required by Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 4(m) and should therefore be dismissed. Epstein files this motion for the sole purpose of having 
the cause dismissed and not to subject himself to service. More importantly, the Complaint may 
have been used by Scott Rothstein and the criminal enterprise Rothstein, Rosenfeldt & Adler, P.A., 
("RRA") (so identified by the United States of America in 
U.S. v. Rothstein, Case No. 09-
6033 I CR-Cohn, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida), in connection with his massive 
Ponzi scheme, which sold investments in fabricated settlements and cases (see infra). 
BACKGROUND 
6. 
The Complaint (DE #1) was filed on July 24, 2009, four months before RRA's 
$1.2 billion Ponzi scheme was exposed in November 2009 and the RRA firm imploded. 
7. 
The U.S government brought an action for Racketeering Conspiracy, Money 
Laundering Conspiracy, Mail and Wire Fraud Conspiracy and Wire Fraud against its chairman 
and CEO, Scott W. Rothstein, for using RRA to run a Ponzi scheme. See Information (DE #1) filed 
in U.S. v. Rothstein, Case No. 09-60331 CR-Cohn, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida. 
8. 
The Information asserts that "RRA was utilized by [Rothstein] ... to unlawfully 
obtain approximately $1.2 billion from investors by fraud in connection with an investment scheme 
commonly known as a 'Ponzi' scheme, in which new investors' funds are utilized to pay previous 
investors in the absence of any underlying security, legitimate investment vehicle or other 
commodity." The Information references Rothstein and other unidentified "co-conspirators". See 
Information ,r6 (DE #1) in Case No. 09-60331CR-Cohn. 
9. 
Rothstein conducted the Ponzi scheme "by fraudulently inducing investors through 
the use of false statements, documents, and computer records to . . . invest funds based upon 
anticipated pay-outs from purported confidential settlement agreement which had been reached

between and among certain individuals .... " See Information if7A (DE #1) in Case No. 09-60331CR-
Cohn. 
10. 
Rothstein manufactured false and fraudulent Court opinions/orders including forging 
the signature of U.S. District Judge, Kenneth A. Marra and U.S. Circuit Court Judge, Susan H. Black, 
1 Ith Circuit in other cases (attached as Exhibit 1 hereto). 
11. 
At Rothstein's June 9, 2010 sentencing hearing, Judge James Cohn departed 
upward from the government's recommendation of 40 years and sentenced Rothstein to 50 years; 
the underlying basis for this upward departure was quoted to be: 
He forged these court orders [referring to the Morse case] to 
perpetrate the Ponzi scheme. 
There can be no conduct more 
reviled than a lawyer perpetrating a fraud on the court. 
12. 
Epstein sued Rothstein, Bradley Edwards and LM for their participation in the 
aforementioned Ponzi scheme in the case styled Epstein v. Rothstein, et al., Case No. 
502009CA040800XXXXMBAG, in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County, 
Florida. 
13. 
Specifically, Epstein alleged that Rothstein used the cases against Epstein (Jane Doe 
v. Epstein, Case No. 08-CIV-80893, U.S.D.C. S.D. Fla., L.M. v. Epstein, Case No. 
502008CA028051XXXXMB AB in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit; and E.W. v. Epstein, Case No. 
502008CA028058XXXXMB AB in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit) as "bait" to lure potential 
investors. 
See 
Complaint 
,r20 
in 
Epstein 
v. 
Rothstein, 
et 
al., 
Case 
No. 
502009CA040800XXXXMBAG. In addition, Epstein alleged that "ROTHSTEIN attempted to lure 
the entity known as D3 Capital Club, LLC, ("D3"), by offering D3 'the opportunity' to invest in 
a pre-suit $30,000,000.00 court settlement against EPSTEIN; yet this supposed settlement never 
existed and was entirely fabricated." Id. if28.

14. 
Consistent with Rothstein's Ponzi scheme, the Complaint makes a number of 
false allegations and may have been shown to investors as part of the Ponzi scheme. These 
include: 
a. LM was identified as a victim by the FBI and U.S. Attorney's office in a criminal 
investigation against Epstein. See DE #1119. However, LM was not on the FBl's or 
U.S. Attorney's "list" referenced in paragraph 19 of the Complaint. 
b. Epstein "coerc[ ed] or fore[ ed] the then-minor L.M. to perform oral sex on him." See 
DE #1 19, However, in her September 24, 2009 deposition LM testified under oath 
(at page 71), that she never had oral sex with Epstein. 
c. Epstein "knowingly transported L.M. and other minors in interstate commerce with 
the intent that the [sic] L.M. engage in prostitution ... " See DE #1 112. However, in 
her February 9, 2010 deposition LM testified under oath (at page 611) she never 
traveled with Epstein. 
15. 
Counsel for L.M. also should know that this action does not and cannot benefit 
from the Non-Prosecution Agreement ("NPA") referenced in the Complaint. L.M. has not 
exclusively pursued 18 U.S.C. §2255 remedies against Epstein in that L.M. has other pending 
litigation where she seeks damages from various state court claims. 
THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS THE COMPLAINT 
16. 
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), "[i]fa defendant is not served within 120 days after 
the complaint is filed, the court - on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff - must dismiss 
the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified 
time." (Emphasis added).

17. 
Epstein requests that the Court dismiss the Complaint (DE #1) due to LM's 
failure to timely effect service pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) and because the Complaint may 
have been used as part of the RRA Ponzi scheme and serves no other legitimate purpose. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, requests the Court enter an order 
dismissing the Complaint (DE #1) and grant any additional relief the Court deems just and 
proper.
