If you want to leave the 
deposition, leave. 
But you'll be back here. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Excuse me. 
If I could just 
make the record, instead of interrupting me, 
please. 
That's what we do professionally. 
There's a recorder here. 
I'm certainly not being 
obstructionist. 
I'm going to make the record. 
But we're going to act with some semblance of 
professionalism, hopefully, by all parties in the 
room. 
That goes to me, that goes to your 
co-counsel sitting behind you and next to you, the 
court reporter and everyone else in the room. 
Everyone is entitled to that. 
You've asked a question. 
She answered the 
question fully and she's not going to be harassed 
because you don't like the answer.

MR. LEOPOLD: 
Just so the record is clear, 
the father -- because the mother was up north. 
MR. TEIN: 
Don't testify, Counsel. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
So the record is clear, just 
the father. 
The mother was --
MR. TEIN: 
Counsel, don't coach and 
testify, please. 
That's absolutely improper. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
You just asked the wrong 
question. 
MR. TEIN: 
You can't coach her that way and 
you well know it. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
For the record, it's the 
father. 
He's remarried, I think on his third 
marriage. 
MR. TEIN: 
You cannot -- it's absolutely, 
totally against the rules and you know it. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
The natural mother lives in 
Georgia. 
MR. TEIN: 
You need to behave yourself, 
lawyer. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
The natural mother lives in

assuming he'll get a copy to the court reporter, 
too, to attach, actually a certified copy to the 
deposition. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Done. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
That's if you agree to that. 
If not, then I want to pull each one out and put 
exhibit labels on them, which we should do before 
we leave. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We're not going to do 
either. 
I'll have copies sent to the court 
reporter and she can attach them to the 
deposition. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
So you're not going to agree 
to what we talked about during the break then.

your asking me to do.

MR. LEOPOLD: 
Okay. 
Sure. 
That's fine. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Okay. 
If you want me to 
go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office and make copies 
and then I'll give those to the court reporter, 
fine. 
All I'm saying is that I would avoid that 
process. 
I would send copies to the court 
reporter.

is it just going to be comma after comma after 
comma? 
Go ahead, lawyer. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
All right. 
The exhibits, I 
can't prevent you from taking them, but I will 
object and I will be bringing it to the court for 
sanctions. 
You cannot take the exhibits out of 
the room without them being marked. 
I want them 
marked, because you cannot identify in the record 
what was used. 
And with all due respect to 
Mr. Goldberger, I do not -- the way this 
deposition is going, I do not want to rely on 
Counsel from Miami to mark the appropriate 
exhibits. 
I will not do that. 
I cannot prevent 
you from taking them. 
But if you do, I will be 
bringing the matter to the court with appropriate 
sanctions, because that is improper. 
That is 
improper. 
When you use something in a deposition, 
they are to be marked. 
And you have refused to do 
that throughout for what ever reason. 
MR. TEIN: 
You're wrong. 
Finish your 
sentence because you're talking about something 
you have no idea.

Every 
single one is already marked.

of issues in this case. 
We're going to have lots 
of reasons to disagree. 
I'm going to take it over now and I'm going 
to make copies and I'm going to give them to 
Ms. Consor. 
If you want to go find some exhibit 
labels and put some exhibit labels on it, be my 
guest. 
But that's what I'm offering to do. 
THE WITNESS: 
Let me say two things, 
because I am happy to always disagree, and with 
you, I have no problem; we could always do it 
professionally. 
I have not problem. 
I want to say two things so the record is 
very clear. 
Since for whatever reason I have not been 
able to look at exhibits, because they have been 
refused to have been shown to me 
MR. TEIN: 
That's a lie. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
-- Jack, if you represent 
that the documents have the appropriate exhibit 
numbers or some identifying markings, 25, 30.000, 
whatever they may be, then you can take them, make 
copies, send me a copy, make sure the court 
reporter gets a copy and then send me a bill for 
my copies, that's fine. 
I didn't know that they 
are marked that way because I haven't been able to

look at them. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
They are barcoded, and the 
number that we've made reference to in the 
deposition coincides with the barcoding. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
That's fine. 
Eight by eleven 
color laser copies are fine. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
The State Attorneys Office 
is not going to charge anybody for color copies I 
print out. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
That's fine. 
He's going to 
take them back to his office. 
Secondly 
and I will be more than happy 
to do it, because it sounds like you all know more 
about it than I -- but I'm happy to get affidavits 
from Mr. Pincus, Judge Stern, everybody else about 
what happened with this hearing today, because I 
know very little about it. 
But my representations 
are what they are. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
They stay --
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Let me just finish for the 
record. 
My representations or comments about what 
happened, representation about this hearing this 
morning, I know very little about it.

that. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
No, no, no. 
I just put it on 
the record. 
I will get an affidavit -- I'm 
assuming it sounds like you need it -- from Mr. 
Pincus. 
I have no clue about what happened and 
why it was canceled. 
All I was told when I was 
out of town yesterday was that the hearing this 
morning was cancelled. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
I'll take your word for 
it. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
If you want an affidavit, 
I'll get it for you. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
It's a personal issue for 
me because I had to disrupt a vacation and if it 
was done just because it wasn't convenient for 
you, then I'm offended by that. 
But if you're 
telling me that it was planned and it didn't 
happen, I'll take your word for it. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
I am more than happy to get 
you an affidavit, because I don't know the reason 
why it was canceled other than the fact that I'm 
assuming since my deposition was taken for four 
hours on Monday for preparation for the hearing 
today, for whatever reason it was canceled, I am 
told it is being re-noticed. 
Why it was canceled,

I have no idea, but if your co-counsel wishes an 
affidavit to that effect from Mr. Pincus, I'm more 
than happy to get it. 
But I don't know the reason 
why it was canceled. 
MR. TEIN: 
I don't need it. 
But what I do 
take issue with is regardless of why it was 
canceled, you owed us the courtesy of saying, You 
know what? 
We can start earlier this morning. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
I owe you nothing. 
MR. TEIN: 
I don't care. 
Don't interrupt 
me. 
Because Jack canceled his vacation plans 
because of you. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
That's all right, that's 
all right. 
MR. TEIN: 
And you're selfish. 
And this 
deposition is over.

CASE NO. 50 2008 CA006596 XXXX MB 
hereto as Exhibit A.) As the Court c,;an see, the agent for the Plaintiff who sc::rved the 
Summons and Complaint purports to have served the same on Tommy Robson, who 
is identified as l-laley Robson's father. Said service was purportedly made at 1224 7 
72nd C::iurt Nortl1, Royal Palm B~ach, Florida, located in Palm Beach County. 
3. 
On March 21, 2008, Haley Robson's usual place of abode was not 
12247 72nd Court North, Royal Palm Beach, Florida, in PalmBeac.:h County. R.ath~:r, 
.Haley Robson's usual place of abode on March 2 l, 2008, was an entirely different 
location. Haley Robson did not authori%e anyone, including Tommy Robson, to 
accept service of process on her behalf Therefore, this .service was not proper and 
was ineffective, 
4. 
It is well recognized in Florida that a person's usual place of abode is 
defined ns !'he place where the person js ac.luaJ!y living at the time of service. See 
Shurman v. Atlarllic Mortgage..and fnw:stmenl Corp., 795 So. 2d 952 (Fla. 2001). In 
the Shmmrn opi 1ion, the Supreme Court of Florida also confirmed that "statutes 
governing servicr~ of process are to be strictly construed and enforced." !.Il.. at 954. 
5. 
The:.·e are diff't:rent schools of thought as to the most appropriate way to 
challenge service of process. There is also some confusfon with regard to whether 
filing a motion other than c1 Motion to Quash Service of Process waives one's right

to move to quash service of process. Therefore, Haley Robson files this Motion to 
Quash Service of P:·ocess in lieu of any other type of motion or responsive pleading 
pursuanr to the Fourth DistTict Court of Appea'l's opmion in Barahan v, S1usmgn, 
which holds that the "preferable manner of presenting a defense of insufficiency of 
service of process .. .-is by a Motion to Quash sucl1 allcged.ly insufficient service of 
process rather than oy a Motion to Dismiss the;: Complaint." .igmban v, Sussman, 439 
So. 2d J046, ./047 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983). 
6. 
Haley Robson reserves the right to supplement thi.s motion with evidence 
to support it. 
\VT·IERRFORE, Haley R.obson respectfully moves this Honorable Court for 
the entry of an Otder granting Haley Robson's Motion to Quash the Servic.:e of 
Process.
