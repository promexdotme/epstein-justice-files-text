Re: 
VE v. Nine East 71st Street, et al., 1:19-cv-07625 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
We represent Plaintiff VE in the above-captioned action.  Plaintiff filed her First Amended 
Complaint in this matter on August 20, 2019. [DE 03].  On November 29, 2019, Defendants filed their 
Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint [DE 36], Declaration in Support [DE 37], and 
Memorandum of Law [DE 38]. 
 
On December 9, 2019, Plaintiff notified the Court and Defendants in writing that Plaintiff did 
not intend to file an amended pleading and would rely on her current First Amended Complaint.   
Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is due December 13, 2019. 
Plaintiff is requesting an extension to file her Opposition to Defendants’ Motion from 
December 13, 2019 to December 18, 2019.  The requested extension would not affect any other 
scheduled dates in this action. 
 
Plaintiff has conferred with Defendants and they have no objection to the requested 
extension. 
 
Respectfully Submitted,
