Re: 
Giuffre v. Maxwell 
Case no. 1:17-mc-00025-RWS 
Regarding Continuance of Hearing on Edwards Subpoena 
Dear Judge Sweet, 
This is an unopposed letter motion requesting a one-week continuance of the 
continuation of the hearing on the Motion to Quash the Subpoena served on Bradley J. 
Edwards. The Court had indicated at the hearing last week that the Edward subpoena 
would not be heard on March 16, but then issued an order directing that the it be heard 
on March 16. 
I serve as counsel for Mr. Edwards on this matter. I have long-scheduled medical 
procedure on Wednesday morning, March 15, which involves general anesthesia. I have 
been advised by my doctor not to embark on a lengthy plane flight (four hours or more) 
until 24 hours have passed from this surgery. Because I maintain my law office as the S.J. 
Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah, it is not 
advisable for me to fly to a hearing in New York City on the evening of March 15. 
Opposing counsel has agreed to this request seeking a one week continuance, 
until March 23, 2017.

Accordingly, I respectfully request that the hearing set for March 16 be continued 
until March 23. Of course, this request does not affect any other matter which the Court 
has set for hearing in the Giuffre v. Maxwell matter. 
Respectfully submitted,
