JANE DOE NO. 8 
Plaintiff, 
V. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
I 
---------------
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein"), by and through his attorneys, moves 
to dismiss Counts I and Ill of Plaintiff's Complaint as the causes of action are barred by 
the applicable statute of limitations.18nd 2 Rule 12(b)(6); Local Gen. Rule 7.1 (S.D. Fla. 
2009). In support of dismissal, Defendant states: 
Plaintiff's Complaint attempts to allege three Counts; the first two counts are 
pursuant to state common law, and the third count is brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§2255. Civil remedy for personal injuries. Count I attempts to allege a cause of action 
for "Sexual Assault and Battery," Count II for "Intentional Infliction of Emotional 
Plaintiffs Complaint attempts to assert both state common law claims and a claim pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. §2255. Since Jane Doe 8 did not relinquish her state claims and correspondingly did not file her 
complaint relying, exclusively, on 18 USC 2255, she is not entitled to the litigation benefits including 
certain waivers that directly or indirectly accrue to other civil plaintiffs from the defendant's fulfilling 
obligations resulting from his separate confidential agreement with the United Staes Attorney's Office. 
Plaintiff's counsel conceded that the provisions of the NPA are not implicated where a plaintiff brings 
additional causes of action and does not proceed exclusively under §2255. See June 12, 2009, Hearing

Distress;" and Count Ill for "Coercion and Enticement to Sexual Activity in Violation of 
18 U.S.C. §2422," pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255. 
Pursuant to the allegations on the face of Plaintiff's complaint, Count I, based on 
Florida's common law of assault and battery, and Count Ill, brought pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. §2255, are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Although a statute of 
limitations bar to a claim is an affirmative defense, and a plaintiff is not required to 
negate an affirmative defense in her complaint, a Rule 12(b )(6) dismissal on statute of 
limitations grounds is appropriate where, as here, "it is 'apparent from the face of the 
complaint' that the claim is time-barred." 
See generally, La Grasta v. First Union 
Securities. Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 -846 (11 th Cir. 2004). 
Count I is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 
As to Count I, which is plead pursuant to state law, it is well settled that this Court 
is to apply Florida law. 
Erie R.Co. v. Tompkins, 58 S.Ct. 817 (1938). Pursuant to 
Florida law, the statute of limitations for assault and battery is four years, §95.11 (3)(o)., 
Fla. Stat. §95.11 (3)( o ), Fla. Stat., provides -
Actions other than for recovery of real property shall be commenced as 
follows: 
* 
* 
* 
(3) Within four years.-
• . . 
(o) An action for assault, battery, false arrest, malicious prosecution, 
malicious interference, false imprisonment, or any other intentional tort, 
except as provided in subsections (4 ), (5), and (7). 
In her Complaint, Plaintiff alleges in relevant part that -
9 .... In or about 2001, Jane Doe, then approximately 16 years old, fell 
into Epstein's trap and became one of his victims.

Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page 3 
According to the allegations of the Complaint, Jane Doe had one encounter with 
Defendant at his Palm Beach mansion in or about 2001 when Jane was approximately 
16 years old. See Complaint, ,J13, endnote 1 hereto.1 Based on the allegations of the 
Complaint, it has been at least 8 years since the alleged conduct by EPSTEIN, well past 
the four year statute of limitations, thus requiring dismissal of Count I. Based on the 
allegations, Plaintiff is now at least 24 years old. 
Subsections (4) and (5) referenced in §95.11 (3)(o) are not applicable. Plaintiff 
may attempt to argue that subsection (7) of §95.11, Fla. Stat. applies. See endnote 2 
hereto for statutory text of subsection (7), including statutes referenced therein.2 
However, a review of Plaintiff's allegations in Count I establish that Plaintiff is attempting 
to assert a cause of action based on the elements of Florida's common law assault and 
battery to which a four year statute of limitation applies. 
(Compare Count II, ,J24, 
wherein Plaintiff tracks the language §39.01 (2), Fla. Stat. (2001 ), pertaining to "abuse."). 
Pursuant to Florida law, although the term "assault and battery" is most 
commonly referred to as if it were a legal unit, or a single concept, "assault and battery 
are separate and distinct legal concepts, assault being the beginning of an act which, if 
consummated, constitutes battery." 3A Fla.Jur.2d Assault §1. An assault and battery 
are intentional acts. See generally, Spivey v. Battaglia, 258 So.2d 815 (Fla. 1972); and 
Travelers lndem. Co. v. PCR. Inc., 889 So.2d 779 (Fla. 2004). 
On the face of the Complaint, the applicable four year statute of limitations has 
expired, and accordingly, Count I is barred an required to be dismissed.

Count 111-18 U.S.C. §2255 
As to the applicable statute of limitations for Count Ill which is brought pursuant to 
18 U.S.C. §2255, §2255(b), (both the 2001 version, which Defendant asserts is the 
applicable statute, and the amended version, effective July 27, 2006), provides: 
(b) Statute of limitations.-Any action commenced under this section 
shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right 
of action first accrues or in the case of a person under a legal disability, 
not later than three years after the disability. 
As noted above, according to the allegations of the Complaint, Jane Doe had one 
encounter with Defendant at his Palm Beach mansion in or about 2001 when Jane was 
approximately 16 years old. See Complaint, ,J13, endnote 1 hereto. Based on the 
allegations of the Complaint, it has been at least 8 years since the alleged conduct by 
EPSTEIN, well past the six year statute of limitations, thus requiring dismissal of Count 
Ill. Based on the allegations, Plaintiff is now at least 24 years old, well pass the age of 
majority. (The age of majority under both federal and state law is 18 years old. See 18 
U.S.C. §2256(1), defining a "minor" as "any person under the age of eighteen years;" 
and §1.01, Definitions, Fla. Stat., defining "minor" to include "any person who has not 
attained the age of 18 years."). Thus, on the face of the Complaint, Count Ill is timed 
barred and required to be dismissed. 
Conclusion 
Accordingly, Counts I and Ill of Plaintiff's Complaint are subject to dismissal. On 
the face of the Complaint, the causes of action which Plaintiff attempts to allege are 
barred by the applicable statute of limitations of 4 and 6 years, respectively.

the massage touched Jane on her breasts and vagina, and he grabbed her hand 
and placed it on his penis. Epstein masturbated himself during the massage. 
Epstein then left money for Jane.
