1. 
The State of Florida charged the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, with Felony 
Solicitation of Prostitution. 
2. 
The State of Florida and Mr. Epstein T-~ to a negotiated resolutiOJl of the 
charges. 
Part of that resolution included an agreement entered into 
between Mr. Epstein and the United States. At the plea conference in 
State court Mr. Epstein plead guilty to the State charges. At the plea 
conference the agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States were 
made part of this Court's record. The agreement was sealed in two 
separate filings. At the time the State court took these matters under seal, 
the proper procedure for sealing such documents had not been followed. 
The June 25th hearing was to give Mr. Epstein, the State, and/or the 
United States an opportunity to comply with the well-defined and narrow 
parameters for sealing such documents. 
After hearing argument of 
counsel, the Court makes the following findings and rulings: 
1) 
Neither the State of Florida nor the U.S. Government nor Mr. Epstein have 
presented sufficient evidence to warrant the sealing of documents 
currently held by the Court. 
2) 
The Motions to seal the Court records are denied. 
3) 
The Motions to intervene are granted. 
4) 
The Motion to unseal the documents is granted.
