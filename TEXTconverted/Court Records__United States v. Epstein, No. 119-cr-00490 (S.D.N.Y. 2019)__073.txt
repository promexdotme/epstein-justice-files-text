RE: Crime Victims’ Rights Act Implications Regarding Unsealing of Grand Jury 
Materials in Epstein Proceedings 
Case:  United States of America v. Jeffrey Epstein 
Case No.:  19 CR 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
We represent numerous survivors of Jeffrey Epstein, including several individuals whose names and 
identifying information appear in the subject materials. In that vein, we write to address the 
Department of Justice’s request to unseal grand jury materials and to respectfully urge the Court to 
administer any disclosure in a manner that fully honors the victims’ rights under the Crime Victims’ 
Rights Act (“CVRA”), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, the enduring interests protected by Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit precedent. 
I.
Victims’ CVRA Rights Are Directly Implicated and Must Be Considered in Context—
Not in a Vacuum
The CVRA guarantees victims:

 
The right to be reasonably protected from the accused (§ 3771(a)(1)); 
 
The right to be heard at any public proceeding involving release, parole, or sentencing (§ 
3771(a)(3)); 
 
The right to confer with the attorney for the Government (§ 3771(a)(5)); and, 
 
The right to be treated with fairness and respect for dignity and privacy (§ 3771(a)(8)). 
 
See also Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court, 435 F.3d 1011, 1016–17 (9th Cir. 2006) (fairness and dignity are 
substantive, enforceable rights); In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391, 394–95 (5th Cir. 2008) (government must 
confer with victims before making consequential case decisions); In re Wild, 994 F.3d 1244 (11th 
Cir. 2021) (en banc) (confirming that CVRA protections are fully attached post-conviction).  
 
Given our history fighting for the enforcement of the CVRA on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein’s many 
victims, we were quite surprised to learn that the government sought the unsealing of grand jury 
materials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a step required 
by the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, 08-80736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro 
bono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government 
previously violated the rights of many of these very same victims.  It is especially troubling that, 
despite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that 
disregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken 
hold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the 
current administration. 
 
Of significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before 
moving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is now the government representing to this Court 
that it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper 
review and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing 
deep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested 
yesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The 
government responded promptly and provided clarification. However, we have strong reason to 
believe that additional individuals—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those 
materials but were not identified to us by the government.  
It remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was 
a government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether 
these individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this 
ambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.  
Against this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose 
or help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and 
protection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined 
in the relief requested below is adopted by this Court.

II. 
Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrow 
Tailoring. 
 
Grand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol 
Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211, 219–23 (1979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant 
must establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any 
disclosure should be no broader than necessary. Id. at 222–23. The Eleventh Circuit has further 
held that district courts lack inherent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions 
in Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d 1226, 1237–38 (11th Cir. 2020) (en banc); see also 
McKeever v. Barr, 920 F.3d 842, 845–46 (D.C. Cir. 2019). 
 
Here, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and 
the traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care: 
rigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and 
meaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce 
this approach. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3509(d)(2) (authorizing protective orders to shield child-victims’ 
identities and “other information concerning a child”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.1 (privacy redactions). 
Many Epstein victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those now adults, § 3771(a)(8) 
and the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with § 3509(d) 
principles. 
 
III. 
Requested Relief 
 
In light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court: 
 
1) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA §§ 3771(a)(5), (c)(1)): Direct the Government to 
confer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard 
before any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials. 
 
2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury 
materials to determine whether the proponent has shown a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any 
disclosure and, if so, the narrowest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil. 
 
3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’ 
counsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a 
strict protective order, to allow victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers, 
(b) combinations of data points that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment 
of victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary. 
 
4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with 
additional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the 
opportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.

5) Defer or Deny Without Prejudice if Safeguards Cannot Be Assured: If adequate safeguards 
cannot be implemented consistent with Rule 6(e), Pitch, and the CVRA, deny disclosure 
without prejudice. 
 
IV. 
Conclusion 
 
The survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy, 
or dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system 
is sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk and trauma.  Several 
victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to 
the trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured 
profound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the 
years following. To now compound their trauma by sidelining them from critical decisions—
especially in this climate of heightened concern—is inconsistent with both the letter and the spirit of 
the CVRA.  
The CVRA, Rule 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit authority all point toward narrow tailoring, maximal 
privacy protections, and meaningful victim participation before any grand jury material sees daylight. 
We respectfully ask the Court to adopt the safeguards outlined above. 
 
Respectfully submitted,
