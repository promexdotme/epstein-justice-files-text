Your Honor: 
 
 
 
We represent the plaintiffs in the three above-referenced cases.  As 
directed in Your Honor’s Order dated September 4, 2020, we write jointly with 
counsel for Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), to provide a status update.  
 
 
 
These cases were stayed on June 22, 2020 pending the plaintiffs in 
each of these cases attempting to resolve their claims against the Co-Executors 
through the Epstein Victims Compensation Program.  The plaintiffs in all three 
cases have registered their claims with the administrators of the Program, and all  
three plaintiffs have either submitted or will shortly submit their claims and 
supporting documents to the administrators.  The parties remain hopeful that all 
claims in these matters will be resolved through the Program.  Accordingly, all 
parties believe that these cases should remain stayed at this time.  We will notify 
the Court once the Program has progressed further such that either the claims are 
resolved or the stays should be lifted. 
 
We appreciate Your Honor’s attention to these matters.  
 
Very truly yours,
