Damn... I just read about your near fatal 
accident. Glad you're alright and unscaved. Its 
close calls like that that make us thank god. 
I'm not very religious myself, but try and do 
the right thing. I was driving down south once 
on 95 and this tour bus almost tipped over on 
us so I know how you feel. The least that 
driver could have done was stopped, but at 
least you didn't hit anything and are OK.

I like country. You going to curb me? How you 
been? I haven't seen you or Will in forever. If 
you think waiting for college is tough, you 
should see me while I wait to ship out. r;rn 
going nuts. Give me a call sometime. Later.

Will looks so damn ridiculous in this picture. He 
looks like he got hit in the back of the head with 
a shovel, and now he's retarded. So the only 
place he can work is Wal-Mart. Or maybe he's 
just high.

Biker Bitch 
Current mood: exhausted 
Category: Automotive 
I am s00000000000000000 tired. Today was the Toys 
For Tots bike rally. My neighbor has a Harley so I 
went with him. It was s00000000000 cool! There was 
400 bikes. It was awesome. I even go to meet this 
guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to 
these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I 
recognized him and went over and talked to him. He 
was really nice. He's having this concert to promote 
his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into 
going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and 
Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving 
iti111111111111111111111111 I donated a football and a 
Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so 
it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. 
Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to. 
Bye!

BUMMER MAN 
Current mood: Q crushed 
Category: School, College, Greek 
I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for FSU on Jan. 5. I'm 
packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making 
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so 
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't 
want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I 
have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to 
go. Have you been through this situation? How did u 
deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 
20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal 
with it.

GGGRRRRRR, 
Current mood: CI pissed off 
I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at 
Victoria's Secret. They said they suspected me 
of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the 
way is bullshit! I was 'by the book' on 
EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I got so fed up in that office that I 
handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and 
walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE MAN! I 
already have another job if I want it, and it's so much 
more money$$$$$$. I'm going to be making more 
money than my old bosses at VS. Success is 
definately the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLESIllm

hey, 
halloween was so much fun! will and i ended up 
going to a party. our makeup was awesome. i only 
have one pic of us up right now but i'll soon have 
more. the one i have up is of us after the make-up 
had been on for hours, 	
it started to peel off in the 
pic but i think it still looks awesome. also, we found 
a red pitbull puppy a few days ago. i wrote a bulletin 
about her but i forgot to add that she is s000000 
good with children. i have an 18 month old living 
with me and she is just s0000 nice to him, she loves 
to play with him and has not shown one sign of 
agression. even with another dog that is bigger than 
her, a cat and a baby constantly bothering her. i 
want to keep her s0000 bad, i just can't tho. 
someone please take hermIll and provide her with a 
good hornet!'  H thank u.

rough times 
Current mood: sad 
Everything sucks right now. 
My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come 
back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.) 
The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying 
in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already 
looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see 
the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or 
her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank 
God she has me. I hope everything ends up being 
okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been 
snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally 
stressed. I'm going through a really tough time. 
There's been so much death around me. It's really 
overwhelming.

Hey, 
Wow! Not living with my parents anymore is da shit! 
For all of you who are not aware, I moved to 
Jacksonville. So far everything is going well. Will 
and I are getting along. Not like everyone 
predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of 
that time together will be horrible,...." the complete 
opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the

second day that we were here but all I did was get 
applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this" 
and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired. 
Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a 
job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an 
hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a 
discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores 
and Bath & Body Works. I like my boss so far, I 
mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool. 
Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I 
think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it. 
The boss guy called him back to set up an interview 
the day he came in with the application, I think that's 
a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right 
now. I got to call him and ask him how it went in a 
lir while. It's only 3:45 right now. Oh, it was so 
funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS 
job and the lady called me back and told me that 
William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence 
that she didn't need to call anyone else back, 	
he 
got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound 
fucking great,..I lied and said that he was the old 
stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str8. No 
complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke 
some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply 
of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back 
home. i love you guys. Don't forget about me.
