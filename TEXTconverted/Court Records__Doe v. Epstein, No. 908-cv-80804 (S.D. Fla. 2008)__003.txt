CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
 
 
 
JANE DOE, a/k/a 
JANE DOE NO. 1, 
 
                      Plaintiff, 
 
vs. 
 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY 
ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, 
 
 
Defendants. 
________________________________/
 
DEFENDANTS JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND SARAH KELLEN’S MOTION 
FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME TO ANSWER OR OTHERWISE 
RESPOND TO COMPLAINT  
 
Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen move, pursuant to Rule 7.1(A) 
of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida, for an enlargement of time to answer or otherwise respond to the amended 
complaint until ten days after their motion for stay, filed contemporaneously with 
this motion, is decided, and as grounds for this relief respectfully state as follows: 
1. 
This civil action is a private counterpart to a pending federal criminal 
action. 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/25/2008   Page 1 of 6

   CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
 
2 
 
3059 GRAND AVENUE, SUITE 340, COCONUT GROVE, FLORIDA 33133 
 
2. 
The pending criminal action purports to arise from the alleged sexual 
assault of a minor, Jane Doe.   
3. 
Mr. Epstein and Ms. Kellen have filed a motion, contemporaneous 
with the filing of this motion, seeking a stay of this action under 18 U.S.C. § 3509.  
Under that section, when an alleged sexual assault involving a child victim results 
in a “criminal proceeding,” a commonly derived civil suit “shall be stayed until the 
end of all phases of the criminal action.” 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added).   
4. 
If Mr. Epstein and Ms. Kellen’s stay motion is granted, they will not 
be required to respond to the complaint or otherwise litigate this action until the 
pending criminal matter is resolved.   
5. 
The undersigned are authorized to represent that defendant Sarah 
Kellen joins in this motion.   
WHEREFORE, Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen respectfully 
request an enlargement of time to answer or otherwise respond to the complaint 
until ten days after their motion for a stay is decided.
