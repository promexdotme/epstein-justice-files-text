United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
Virginia L. Giuffre,
Plaintiff, 
Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS
v.
Ghislaine Maxwell,
Defendant. 
________________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S SECOND AMENDED SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE AND  
OBJECTIONS TO DEFENDANT’S FIRST SET OF 
DISCOVERY REQUESTS TO PLAINTIFF
Plaintiff hereby serves her second amended supplemental responses and objections to 
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests violates Local Civil Rule 33.3. Defendant 
has served interrogatories that are in direct violation of that Rule because the interrogatories are 
not “restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with knowledge of information relevant to 
the subject matter of the action, the computation of each category of damage alleged, and the 
existence, custodian, location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent 
insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar nature.” Local 
Civil Rule 33.3(a). Instead, they seek information under subsections (b) and (c) of Local Civil 
Rule 33.3, and therefore, they should not be served because they are not “a more practical 
method of obtaining the information sought than a request for production or a deposition,” and 
because they were served in advance of the period “30 days prior to the discovery cut-off date.”

broad under Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P. Specifically, Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as 
overly burdensome to the extent that they would require logging voluminous and ever-increasing 
privileged communications between Ms. Giuffre and her counsel after the date litigation 
commenced on September 21, 2015. Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as overly burdensome to 
the extent that they would require logging voluminous privileged documents between Ms. 
Giuffre and her counsel related to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, Case no. 08-
80736-CIV-Marra, pending in the Southern District of Florida; Bradley Edwards and Paul 
Cassell v. Alan Dershowitz, Case no. CACE 15-000072, pending in the Seventeenth Judicial 
Circuit, Broward County, Florida; and Jane Doe No. 102 v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 09-80656-
CIV-Marra/Johnson (Southern District of Florida).  Accordingly, due the undue burden of 
individually logging responsive privileged documents related to Defendant’s overly broad 
requests, Plaintiff has employed categorical logging of such privileged responsive documents 
pursuant to Local Civil Rule 26.2(c).
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests in that they seek to invade her privacy for the sole 
purpose of harassing and intimidating Ms. Giuffre who was a victim of sexual trafficking.  Ms. 
Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent they are overly broad and unduly burdensome.
Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s definition of “your attorneys” because it includes 
names of attorneys that do not represent her, including Spencer Kuvin and Jack Scarola.
Ms. Giuffre’s responses to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests are being made 
after reasonable inquiry into the relevant facts, and are based only upon the information and 
documentation that is presently known to her.  Ms. Giuffre reserves the right to modify and/or 
supplement her responses.  Ms. Giuffre is producing documents and information herewith, and 
she will continue to review and produce relevant documents until completion.
