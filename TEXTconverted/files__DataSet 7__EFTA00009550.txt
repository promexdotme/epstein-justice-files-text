Police Department as one of the girls who had frequented 
Mr. Epstein's house. 
Q 
How exactly did the Palm Beach Police Department 
determine that she was one of those girls? 
A 
When they did their search warrant at 
Mr. Epstein's residence, some message pads were obtained 
at his residence, and they had several calls from a girl 
named 
, and phone numbers. So they were able to 
track back those messages back to 
Q 
Did the Palm Beach Police Department try to 
interview Miss 
A 
They did. 
• 
Did she agree to speak with them? 
A 
No. She stated that she loved Jeffrey Epstein, 
and that she would not say anything positive or negative 
about what occurred. 
Q 
After the FBI became involved in this 
investigation, did you try to interview Miss 
A 
We did, as well, with no such luck, as well. 
Q 
How long ago was it that you first made contact 
with Miss 
A 
It was back in November of '06. 
Q 
Did you try to serve her with a subpoena issued 
on behalf of this grand jury? 
A 
Yes, we did.

Q 
What happened? 
A 
She refused service of the grand jury subpoena. 
here, and a subpoena was left with her. 
Q 
After that, did she obtain an attorney? 
A 
Yes, she did. 
Q 
Who was that? 
A 
Jim Eisenberg. He's a well-known defense 
attorney here in West Palm Beach. 
Q 
Who paid for that attorney? 
A 
Mr. Epstein is paying for 
attorney. 
Q 
Now once Miss 
secured the attorney, did 
she agree to be interviewed? 
A 
Yes, she did, after she was granted 6001 
immunity. She requested immunity. 
Q 
Did the justice department authorize that grant 
of immunity? 
A 
Yes, they did. 
Q 
After that, did she agree to be interviewed? 
A 
Yeah. It was only after she was given that 
immunity that she would talk with us. 
Q 
When did the interview take place? 
A 
It took place at the end of April of this year, 
so just a few weeks ago. 
Q 
Who was present at that interview?

Q 
what did Miss 
tell you about Jeffrey 
5 
Epstein? 
6 
A 
She stated that she had met an individual by the 
7 
name of 
at a party who had asked her if she 
8 
wanted to make a few bucks by giving a man a massage. She 
9 
was told that Mr. Epstein preferred them to be topless, 
10 
and she agreed to go to his house to give him a massage. 
11 
Q 
How old did Miss 
tell you she was at that 
12 
time? 
13 
A 
She stated she was 16 when she first started 
14 
giving Mr. Epstein massages. 
15 
Q 
Based upon your review of the evidence, is that 
16 
correct? 
17 
A 
No. We have phone records where 
18 
(phonetic), Mr. Epstein's assistant, is contacting 
19 
on her cell phone, or using her cell phone to call 
20 
cell phone starting in April of 2004, which makes 
21 
15. 
22 
Q 
So she said that she was 16, but your evidence 
23 
shows that she was 15, and she said that she was told she 
24 
could make a few bucks giving a topless massage? 
25 
A 
Yes.

Q 
What else did Miss MN 
tell you? 
A 
That she went to Mr. Epstein's residence, that 
took her there the first time, that when she went 
upstairs she was paid $200 when she first got there by 
Then she goes upstairs, and Mr. Epstein 
comes in, he disrobes, puts on a towel, lays down on the 
massage table and she begins to massage him.

She tells Epstein that she heard he likes 
topless massages, and he told her that he did. And she 
10 
said, 'who wouldn't?• And she ended up taking off her top 
11 
during the first massage. But 
is clear that Mr. 
12 
Epstein did not at any point touch her during the massage. 
13 
Q 
But does she admit that he 
14 
A 
Yes. On the second massage, Mr. Epstein asked 
15 
her to leave her phone number with 
. Her phone number 
16 
was left there. On the second massage, she returned the 
17 
very next day and gave him another massage. This time,

admit that

tell you that she performed massages?

but just said that it was a lot, and that she had been 
giving him massages for a year. 
Q 
You mentioned to the grand jury that Miss 
said that Mr. Epstein never touched her, correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And she was very adamant about that? 
A 
Yes, she was. 
Q 
Were there other things that she was adamant 
about in her interview with you? 
A 
Well, she talked about what she would tell the 
girls that -- and that she told Mr. Epstein that she was 
18. I'm sorry, I take that back. She was told to say 
that she was 18, and she told us that she had a fake I.D. 
showing that she was 18. 
So she passed that information along to the 
other girls when she brought -- eventually she brought 
other girls to perform massages, and that was one of the 
things that she told -- she told us first that she brought 
18- to 20-year old girls. And then she stated that if the 
girls lied, and they were underage, she told them that 
they needed to tell Epstein that they were 18. 
Q 
Have you been able to identify some of the girls 
that Miss 
brought to Mr. Epstein's home? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Were any of those girls over 18?

Have any of the girls who came through

10 
were 18, but not on every occasion would Mr. Epstein

Q 
Do you want to check your records on that? 
A 
Yes, could I do that? 
• 
Yes, please do. 
A 
I can tell you that one of the girls that she 
brought -- this girl told Mr. Epstein that she was in high 
school, and actually told him her true age, which was 
Q 
So what 
told you about, that wasn't 
A 
No, that wasn't. Sorry. 
Q 
That's all right, I just wanted to make sure 
So Miss 
told you that she had been told

fake I.D.? 
2 
A 
Yes. 
3 
Q 
Did she ever say that Mr. Epstein either asked 
4 
for her age or asked to see her I.D.? 
5 
A 
No, the topic never came up. 
6 
Q 
Did you also ask her about how appointments were 
7 
made? 
8 
A 
Yes. She was very clear in the fact that 
9 
would call her to arrange the appointments, but 
10 
that 
would call her once Jeffrey was in town. 
11 
Q 
So she was adamant that the calls only happened 
12 
when she was already here? 
13 
A 
Yes. 
14 
Q. 
Were you made aware that Epstein's counsel was 
15 
informed that he was being investigated for traveling to 
16 
engage in prostitution, which means that the appointments 
1/ 
would have been made before the traveling? 
18 
A 
Yes. 
19 
Q 
Was there anything else, besides the issue of 
20 
age and the issue of when the appointments were made, that 
21 
sounded coached or that she was especially adamant about? 
22 
A 
No, I wouldn't say coached. I mean, we talked 
23 
about the preferences that Jeffrey discussed, as far as 
24 
which girls he would like 
to bring.

started giving massages to Epstein,

told us that he liked different faces, so he would 
ask her to bring other girls. We asked her if he ever 
gave any preferences of what he preferred, and her 
response was that Epstein liked girls like her, which is 
thin and blond and attractive. 
Q 
And how old was she at the time? 
A 
She was 15. 
Q 
So thin, blonde, attractive and --
A 
Young, girls like her. I guess we asked if she 
ever made a mistake, or ever brought somebody that Mr. 
Epstein didn't take to. She said that she had screwed up 
and that she had brought a black girl to Mr. Epstein, and 
that Epstein was not interested in black girls. But he 
did pay her, and said that he wasn't a racist. He paid 
her the $200 for her time, but did not want her to perform 
a massage for him. 
Q 
And he didn't allow that girl to perform a 
massage? 
A 
No. 
Was there anything else that Miss 
talked 
about in the interview that you want to share with the 
grand jury? 
A 
I did ask her at the end of the interview if she 
was in love with Mr. Epstein. She looked into the camera 
and said that she loved him like a friend. But then she 
Copyl of13 
EFTA00009560

Page 12 
1 
kind of looked into the camera and gave a wink and a smile 
2 
and said, "But with your money, I'd marry you any time, 
3 
Jeffrey." 
4 
Q 
Did she also say that she considered him to be 
5 
an •awesome guy'? 
6 
A 
Several times she referred to him as an "awesome 
7 
guy° • 
She said that the girls begged her to come and that 
8 
the girls didn't have a complaint, and the girls would 
9 
share with her everything that happened after the massage, 
10 
11 
12 
and that Jeffrey never touched any of the girls. But as I 
informed you, we did interview some of the girls that she 
took, and he has touched them. 
13 
Q 
In preparation for your testimony today, did you 
14 
also speak with someone who is considered to be an expert 
15 
in these cases? 
16 
A 
YeS. 
17 
Q 
And what is that person's name? 
18 
A 
19 
Q 
Has Mr. 
been qualified to testify as an 
20 
expert in federal and state courts in cases that involve 
21 
what he calls "compliant victims"? 
22 
A 
Yes. 
23 
Q 
what does he mean by the term "compliant 
24 
victims"? 
25 
A 
A compliant victim is when a victim is not

necessarily forced into the conduct that the offender 
wants them to engage into, that they actually consent to 
that kind of activity. 
Q 
So that would include minors who are subjected 
to sexual activity but weren't necessarily kidnapped or 
forced at gunpoint, or something like that? 
A 
Exactly. 
Q 
Did he discuss with you the difficulties that 
exist when you interview those types of victims? 
A 
Yes. He stated that a compliant victim is often 
times embarrassed that they went along with the behavior. 
They are also likely to deny the behavior, especially when 
being interviewed by investigators, that they'll deny it 
or they'll minimize it. Sometimes it takes two, three or 
multiple interviews to get compliant victims to either 
trust their interviewer or realize that their interviewer 
is not going to be judgemental. 
Q 
In this case, have you found that to be the case 
with some of the interviews? 
A 
Yes, I have. 
Q 
In addition to being embarrassed, sometimes 
these victims feel guilty about the fact that they were 
involved in this type of activity? 
A 
Oh, yes. 
Q 
Does Mr. 
also have expertise in sexual 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009562

Page 14 
1 
preference of offenders? 
2 
A 
Yes, he does. 
3 
Q 
Did he explain why an offender would select the 
4 
types of victims that are involved in this case, girls 
5 
between 14 and 17-years-old? 
6 
A 
This type of offender, the sexual preference he 
7 
has is for post-pubescent females that are physically 
8 
developed but not necessarily mentally matured. The girls 
9 
ranging in this age are sometimes inexperienced, they are 
10 
possibly naive, not as worldly. 
11 
An offender of this type could also maybe not 
12 
feel sexually adequate or feel competent dealing with his 
13 
own age group. So knowing that these girls are less 
14 
experienced, may focus on them as well. 
15 
Q 
In addition to their emotional immaturity, did 
16 
Mr. 
talk about whether or not younger girls are 
17 
easier to manipulate than grown women? 
18 
A 
Yes. 
19 
Q 
Did he talk to you about "grooming"? 
20 
A 
Yeah. That's what an offender will use with a 
21 
compliant victim. He told us that grooming is a technique 
22 
where you gain the cooperation of those victims by 
23 
focusing on their interests and playing up to those 
lled it. That 
24 
interests. It's a type of seduction, he ca 
25 
was his words for it. And we actually see this in this

case. 
Can you give us an example of some of the types 
of grooming that Mr. Epstein used? 
A 
With one of the girls we're going to talk about 
today, 
, it's very apparent interviewing her how 
Epstein groomed her. She only went to three or four 
massages at this time, that she's admitted to. We feel 
that due to her phone conversations, the multiple calls, 
that there may be more there. At this point she has 
stated to us that she has performed three or four massages 
for Mr. Epstein. 
what he did is when she first went there he 
played upon -- she was very shy, and he would play upon 
that shyness. He told her that she was pretty. He asked 
her to remove her clothing, and she would not. So he kind 
of kidded around with her shyness and complimented her, 
showed interest in her, talked about her boyfriend and 
different interests she had. 
At the end of that interview, because she did 
not take off her clothes, he tells her that if she's 
willing to do more, she will make more. He also tells her 
that he would pay her if she would bring other girls. As 
the massages increased, you can see that the next time she 
comes he plays again to that shyness, but he gets a little 
bit more -- I guess he sees that it's not working. This

time she does comply and takes off her -- he asked her to 
disrobe on the second massage. She takes off her blouse, 
but she refuses to take off the bra after Mr. Epstein 
asked her to. 
So you can see that he tries through showing 
interest. And then he actually -- when he sees that this 
isn't working, he takes a more authoritative role with her 
in the last massage. She said that throughout all of 
these massages he was very nice, and then at the end he 
was much more frustrated and irritated. She does get down 
to her bra and panties on that one, he's just much 
more authoritative. 
So he started with the grooming process, tried 
to get her interest, tried to use that to get her to 
comply with removing her clothes. But as often happens, 
at the end of this, he took over and was much more 
forceful with his requests. 
Q 
Have other girls described that same situation 
where every time they went back, he tried to push it one 
step further and one step further? 
A 
Yes. Several of the girls have said that he 
would always push for more and more. 
Q 
Did Mr. 
explain why it is that a 
compliant child victim cannot legally consent to the 
sexual conduct? 
EFTA00009565

Page 17 
1 
A 
Yeah. He stated that -- you know, we talked 
2 
about how the law protects children, and stated that we 
3 
hold adults accountable. When it comes to adolescents, 
4 
they go through normal tendencies that mature offenders 
5 
may try to take advantage of. But the law is in place for 
6 
that reason, to protect -- in the federal law, to protect 
7 
those individuals under the age of 18. 
8 
Q 
And that's because of the different maturity 
9 
levels of the --
10 
A 
The offender versus the victims, exactly. 
11 
Q 
Did you put together the photographs of the 
12 
defendants in this case? 
13 
A 
Yes, I did. 
14 
Q 
Are these photographs of the four human 
15 
defendants who are named in the proposed indictment? 
16 
A 
Yes. 
17 
Q 
With their names underneath them? 
18 
A 
Yes. 
19 
Q 
Agent, who is in the top left-hand corner? 
20 
A 
That's Jeffrey Epstein. 
21 
Q 
when was this photograph taken? 
22 
A 
Recently. There was an article that just came 
23 
out regarding Mr. Epstein and his connection, or his 
24 
personal relationship with Prince Andrew, and that was a 
25 
picture that was in that article.

(phonetic).

Has Miss

probably next week. She did say on one or two occasions 
3 
that 
had called her when she had gone out 
to California on a trip, I believe. But that is the only

Could you briefly refresh the grand jury's 
23 
recollection of how she was recruited? 
24 
A 
She was approached on a beach by 
25 
discussions, about a specific act that was performed. 
that one of the girls when interviewed had alleged 
rape, and I hadn't heard about that allegation 
recently. 
THE WITNESS: That's probably Jane Doe Number 6. 
We're going to talk about her, that he forcibly put 
her on the table and 
Yeah, she will 
be coming up. We're going to do her probably next 
week. She'll be the first one we'll talk about.

and 
20 
that indicate the calls took place, as well as phone 
21 
records for

22 
place on or about those dates. We've also looked at a

flight manifest, and were able to show that Mr. Epstein 
24 
arrived the day before, on the 11th. We also have 
25 
statement where she describes the sexual activity that

Q 
And she stated that Mr. Epstein is the person 
12

13 
A 
She told us that in her statement. 
14 
Q 
If you could take a look at Overt Act Number 95, 
15 
which is on page 17. On or about February 6, 2005, 
16 
Epstein had Jane Doe Number 1 to make one or more 
17 
telephone calls to Jane Doe Number 2. 
18 
First of all, who is Jane Doe Number 2? 
19 
A 
That would be 
, our youngest victim. 
20 
Q 
Can you tell us what evidence you have related 
21 
to that overt act? 
22 
A 
We have the girl's statements that calls were 
23 
made. We also reviewed the phone records that indicated 
24 
that there was telephonic contact between the numbers 
25 
belonging to 
and 
EFTA00009575

Page 27

Q 
And in the statement of both girls, did they

describe that 
is the person who called 
3 
looking for someone to come and work at Mr. Epstein's 
4 
house? 
5 
A 
Yes. 
6 
Q 
Looking at Overt Act Number 96. On or about 
7 
February 6, 2005, Epstein caused Jane Doe Number 1 to

Q 
If you could look at Overt Act Number 117, which 
is on page 19, and that states that on or about March 30, 
2005, 
caused one or more calls to be made to a 
telephone used by Jane Doe Number 1. 
what evidence do you have related to that? 
A 
We reviewed the phone records of 
and 
that indicate this. 
Q 
And Overt Act 120, on or about March 31, 
caused one or more calls to be made to a telephone used by 
Jane Doe Number 1. 
A 
Again, we reviewed the phone records that 
indicated there was telephonic contact between the numbers 
belonging to

Q 
Then we have Overt Act Number 122, which is also 
March 31, that Epstein and 
caused Jane Doe Number 1 
to make a call to a telephone used by Jane Doe Number 2. 
What evidence do you have related to that?

day. We also again have another recorded voice mail by 
, left on 
phone. 
• 
These later calls, the March-April calls, are 
those the controlled calls that the Palm Beach Police 
Department was involved in? 
A 
There was controlled calls placed to 
cell phone and to 
place of work by 
under the 
supervision of the Palm Beach Police Department. 
Q 
And the voice mail message that you referred to 
of 
calling 
, what information was 
leaving 
in that voice mail message? 
A 
was asking for 
to get back in touch, 
that she had set up an appointment for 
at Epstein's 
house on the following day, on that Saturday at around 
10:30 or 11:00. 
Q 
In addition to the phone records, was there 
anything that the Palm Beach Police Department found that 
also confirmed that this appointment actually was made. 
A 
As I mentioned earlier, the Palm Beach Police 
Department was doing trash pulls on Mr. Epstein's 
25 
residence. In there, there were two messages or notes in

there on Epstein's personalized stationary. On it it 
said, "

on Saturday at 10:30, and 
on 
Saturday with 
at 10:30." That's the exact message on 
the two notes that were found in his trash when they 
retrieved it on April 8. 
Q 
If I could direct your attention to Count Number 
Five, which appears on page 26. That is the charge of 
enticement of a minor, referring to Jane Doe Number 1, and 
Mr. Epstein and 
are charged. 
I know that you talked about the telephone 
traffic. The calls between 
and 
, did 
they fall within that March 7 through March 11 time 
period? 
A 
A review of their telephone records do indicate 
that there were phone calls made during that time. 
Q 
And Jane Doe Number 1 actually went to Mr. 
Epstein's home? 
A 
Yes, and performed a massage for him in the 
nude. 
Q 
And she was paid for that? 
A 
Yes, she was paid $200. 
Q 
And he 
, correct? 
A 
Yes, he did. I would like to include that 
took 
upstairs for that massage, and she also 
set up the massage table and arranged the oil and lotions 
EFTA00009579

Page 31

for IIIII to do that massage. 
2 
Q 
And also, just so it's clear, how old was 
3 
at that time? 
4 
A 
She was 17. 
: Are there any questions about 
6 
either how that evidence was presented or about the 
7 
charges related to Jane Doe Number 1? Seeing no 
8 
questions, we'll turn to Jane Doe Number 2.

10 
Q 
You previously mentioned that that was

A 
Yes.

Q 
Let's turn to Count Number Six, which is on page

If you could tell 
14 
the grand jury about the evidence related to that. 
15

date of birth is

A 
She was 14. 
19 
Q 
Can you remind the grand jury about the evidence 
20 
related to the enticement of 
21 
A 
As we stated earlier, we talked about the 
22 
telephone calls. We have shown that the facility of 
23 
interstate commerce was used by the telephone calls made 
24 
by their cell phones. We examined specifically 
25 
and 
. Those calls were made to

set up and arrange appointments for Mr. Epstein to have 
2 
his massages. 
3 
Pertaining to 
, during the massage that 
4 
occurred on those dates, February 6, in particular, I 
5 
think I have discussed with you before what occurred on 
6 
that, that he 
7 
it -- and that he 
8 
He did

during that massage, and she 
10 
. She was paid $300, and we know that she was 14 
11 
12 
13 
at the time. 
Q 
If we could turn to Count Number 43, which 
appears on page 31. Count 43 is one of the travel counts. 
14 
If you could tell the grand jury, did a trip occur on 
15 
March 31, 2005? 
16 
A 
Yes, we have flight records that indicate a 
17 
flight occurred on that date. 
18 
Q 
what type of plane was used? 
19 
A 
I'm going to refer to the J.E.G.E., Incorporated 
20 
aircraft as just the Boeing 727. If we talk about the 
21 
Hyperion Air, Incorporated aircraft, which is the Gulf 
22 
Stream, I will just say the Gulf Stream. So on that date 
23 
he did travel on his Boeing 727, on 3-31. 
24 
Q 
And Mr. Epstein was aboard the plane on that 
25 
day? 
EFTA00009581

Q 
With respect to the March 31st trip, was there

we do have telephonic contact between illilland 
6 
EMI 
as well as 
and 
on the day before 
7 
and the day of travel. 
8 
Q 
And even though that appointment was never kept, 
9 
that 
never went to that appointment, you have the 
10 
notes that were retrieved from the garbage that showed 
11 
that Mr. Epstein was expecting 
to show up for that 
12 
appointment? 
13 
A 
Yes. 
14 
Q 
Anything else with respect to that particular 
15 
count? 
16 
A 
We also have the controlled calls and the voice 
17 
mails. 
18 
Q 
Turning to Count Number 60, which appears on 
19 
page 34, that is the attempted enticement of

A 
She was 14.

were used. One Of the things that is relevant to this 
25 
particular count was that in addition to the fact that

10 
came. 
11 
Q 
When you talked with 
, did 
talk about 
12 
girls that Mr. Epstein liked in particular? 
13 
A 
Yes. 
14 
Q 
And was 
one of those girls? 
15 
A 
Yes, she was one of his preferences.
