DARREN K. INDYKE, in his capacity as 
EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF JEFFREY

PLAINTIFF’S REPLY TO CO-EXECUTORS’ BRIEF 
PURSUANT TO MARCH 17, 2021 ORDER 
 
Plaintiff, GHISLAINE MAXWELL (hereinafter, “Plaintiff”), pursuant to this Court’s 
Order dated March 17, 2021, hereby files her reply to the brief filed on March 29, 2021 by Co-
Executors Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn (the “Co-Executors”). In short, Plaintiff 
agrees that the Court should not designate this matter complex or assign the case to the judge 
assigned to Case No. ST-2020-CV-00014, Government of the Virgin Islands v. Darren K. 
Indyke, et al. (the “CICO action”).  
 
First, this action for indemnification does not meet the Complex Litigation Division’s 
assignment criteria. Plainly, this case does not “require[] exceptional judicial management to 
avoid placing unnecessary burdens on the court or the litigants and to expedite the case, keep 
costs reasonable, and promote effective decision making by the court, the parties, and counsel.”

V.I. R. Civ. P. 92(a). Nor does this action fit within any of the categories of “presumptively 
complex claims” established by V.I. R. Civ. P. 92(b). Plaintiff’s claims do not involve a mass 
tort or toxic tort; do not involve a design defect; do not arise out of a natural disaster; are not a 
class action; and do not involve insurance claims arising out of multi-party proceedings. Further, 
none of the factors in V.I. R. Civ. P. 92(c)(1)—which all relate to mass tort fact patterns—
applies here. Finally, the factors enumerated in V.I. R. Civ. P. 92(c)(2) strongly weigh against 
assignment. Notably, as far as Plaintiff is aware, no judge is presently assigned to the Complex 
Litigation Division. Assigning this action to a division without a judge will only cause 
unreasonable delay and increase the burden on the judicial system and on the parties. See, e.g., 
Highland Credit Opportunities CDO, Ltd v. Evans-Freke, 2021 WL 1040502, *6 (V.I. Super. 
Mar. 17, 2021) (“[D]esignating this case as complex now, when there is no judge assigned 
exclusively to the Complex Litigation Division at this moment, would be tantamount to staying 
the case.”)  There is also no apparent need for specialized expertise or case processing here, and 
no advantage to coordinating discovery or other procedures with any other action.   
 
Second, there is no reason to assign the case to the same judge assigned to the CICO 
action. Plaintiff is not a party to the CICO action. To Plaintiff’s knowledge, there are no facts or 
claims in common between this action and the CICO action.  Therefore, assignment of this case 
to the same judge handling the CICO action is not necessary to avoid delay or inconsistent 
rulings.

CONCLUSION 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this case not be transferred to the 
Complex Litigation Division and that it remain with its presently assigned judge.
