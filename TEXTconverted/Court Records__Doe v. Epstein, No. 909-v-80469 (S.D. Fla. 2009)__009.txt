DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS COURT'S ORDER TO 
SHOW CAUSE AS WHY ALL CASES SHOULD NOT BE CONSOLIDATED FOR DISCOVERY 
PURPOSES AND MOTION TO CLARIFY THE COURT'S ORDER DATED APRIL 28, 2009 
Defendant, JEFFERY EPSTEIN, (EPSTEIN), by and through his undersigned 
attorneys, hereby files his Response in Opposition to this Court's Order to Show Cause 
as to Why All Cases Should Not be Consolidated for Purposes of Discovery and Motion 
for Clarification of this Court's Order on general consolidation of discovery (DE 6), and 
states: 
I. 
Response In Opposition 
Defendant has no further objections to consolidating these cases for 
purposes of depositions as outlined in this Court's April 28, 2009 Order. 
However, to consolidate the cases for purposes of all "discovery" including, but 
not limited to, motion practice and related orders thereto will, without question, confuse 
many of the individual discovery issues raised not only by Epstein as to the individual 
Plaintiffs that have brought separate lawsuits against him, but will also confuse the 
individual discovery issues raised by those same individual Plaintiffs as to Epstein. This 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 2 of 5

will undoubtedly lead to several motions to clarify certain orders which will seek 
explanation from the court as to how those orders affect Epstein as to each individual 
Plaintiff's discovery requests and vice versa (i.e., how those future orders affect the 
individual Plaintiffs' discovery requests directed to Epstein). 
It is important to note that each related Federal matter before this court has its 
very own distinct set of facts and defenses thereto. As such, the discovery served and 
the responses received are particular and individualized as to both Plaintiff and 
Defendant. 
As such, discovery of "all" cases for general discovery consolidation 
(separate and apart from depositions) will only cloud rulings on discovery and will result 
in more attorney labor and judicial resources, which will inevitably be spent on motions 
for clarification. 
Each Plaintiff and Epstein have served and will in the future serve separate 
requests for production, separate interrogatories, separate requests for admissions, and 
separate motions to compel, responses and replies addressing certain discovery issues. 
Obviously, both Plaintiff and Defendant will base their discovery related arguments on 
the particularized facts of each case, which are separate and distinct from one another. 
Moreover, the Plaintiffs will likely seek to retain different experts to support their 
individual claims. In that regard, how will a general consolidation of discovery impact 
discovery related to those experts' individualized opinions? 
As this court is aware, certain case management orders are in place setting the 
parameters of discovery. It is unclear how Plaintiffs' Motion to Consolidate and the 
Courts Order will handle the potential problems and any other potential discovery 
related issues outlined above. In fact, it appears that Jane Doe, in Case No. 08-CV-

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 3 of 5
Page 3 
80893 (DE 47), has expressed her own reasons for opposing the consolidation all the 
cases for discovery purposes. Obviously, Jane Doe's counsel, like the undersigned, 
anticipates that discovery issues will present themselves if general consolidation occurs 
and does not want it to impact her case. 
In fact, the debates have already begun in 
light of this Court's April 29, 2009 Order and the responses filed addressing same. This 
provides the court with a glimpse of what will occur if general consolidation occurs, in 
particular, how attorney resources and judicial resources will be unnecessarily used. 
In addition, the initial style of each case should be maintained in pleadings and in 
orders in an effort to maintain organization and application of the rulings this court 
espouses for each case. Utilizing a compound multiple-type style will only confuse 
cases that should be kept separate for all discovery purposes. 
II. 
Motion for Clarification of this Court's April 28, 2009 Order 
This Court ruled that cases 08-80119, 08-80232, 08-80380 and 08-80993 are 
consolidated for discovery purposes. 
Epstein not only objects to the court's 
consolidation order but seeks clarification from this Court as to how consolidation of 
general discovery will impact motion practice and orders in the above cases. What does 
the court mean when it says the above cases are consolidated "for purposes of 
discovery only?" How does consolidation operate? The concerns addressing general 
discovery consolidation are set out above and are therefore incorporated herein. 
Likewise, for those reasons, the court should reverse its ruling on consolidation and 
issue a new order maintaining the individuality of each case for discovery purposes. 
In addition, Epstein not only objects to the court's potential consolidation of case 
numbers 08-80381, 08-80994, 08-80811, 08-80893, 09-80469 and 09-80591 for 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 4 of 5
Page4 
general discovery purposes, but respectfully requests that this court clarify how 
consolidation of general discovery will impact motion practice and orders in the above 
cases should this court choose to consolidate same for discovery. Again, how does 
consolidation operate? 
The concerns addressing general discovery consolidation are 
set out above and are therefore incorporated herein. 
In short, the Motions seeking consolidation for discovery purposes only do not 
delineate how consolidation operates. 
As such, the Order granting the Motions to 
Consolidate for discovery purposes only does not provide any additional information 
addressing how consolidation will operate. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court not consolidate case numbers 
08-80381, 08-80994, 08-80811, 08-80893, 09-80469 and 09-80591, that it clarify its 
order as to consolidation of case numbers 08-80119, 08-80232, 08-80380 and 08-
80993 (or the future consolidation of other cases) and that it reverse its April 28, 2009 
ruling on general consolidation in light of the potential problems presented in this 
response, that an order be entered requiring the parties to utilize the style secured by 
the initial case filing and not a compound-case style incorporating all case styles in one 
particular document, and for such other and further relief a;Jtiis Court -~eems just and 
proper.
