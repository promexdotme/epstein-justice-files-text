PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S OBJECTION TO EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE APPEAL 
AND, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, REQUEST FOR DIRECTION TO EPSTEIN TO BEGIN 
ASSEMBLING MATERIALS 
 
 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe, respectfully files this Objection to Defendant’s Motion for 
Extension of Time (dkt. #464). 
Epstein is apparently requesting an additional 15 days from February 18, 2010, 
to file an objection to an order from the magistrate judge that he produce documents 
that were provided to him by the Government during the discovery phase of the criminal 
case.  As the magistrate judge concluded, any purported Fifth Amendment objection to 
producing such documents is utterly groundless.  The Fifth Amendment protects a 
defendant from revealing things to the Government that it does not know.  The 
Government obviously knows what is in the documents that it gave to him.  Therefore, 
there is no legitimate Fifth Amendment objection to such production.

In addition, 15 days on top of the already prescribed 10 days to appeal is an 
excessively long period of time.  As the Court is aware, the discovery period prescribed 
in this case will soon draw to a close.  Jane Doe needs the documents produced quickly 
and in a timely fashion so that she can pursue any leads revealed in them during the 
discovery period. 
 
In the alternative, if the Court grants any extension of time to file an appeal, Jane 
Doe respectfully requests that the extension order also include a direction to Epstein to 
fully assemble all of the required documents so that, if Epstein’s appeal is rejected, the 
documents can be produced to Jane Doe without any further delay.
