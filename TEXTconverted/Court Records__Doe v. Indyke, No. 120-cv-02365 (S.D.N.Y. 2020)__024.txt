Re: 
Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as 
the Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF
Dear Judge Freeman: 
Pursuant to the Court’s September 4, 2020 Order (ECF No. 15), Plaintiff and 
Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein, jointly submit this status report. 
Plaintiff has submitted her claim to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program

against Defendants via the Program, the parties will thereafter promptly discontinue this 
action with prejudice. 
To preserve the parties’ resources and in the interests of judicial economy, the 
parties respectfully request that this case remain stayed at this time. 
Respectfully submitted,
