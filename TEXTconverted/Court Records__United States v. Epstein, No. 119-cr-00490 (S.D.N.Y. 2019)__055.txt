CHAMBERS OF 
RICHARD M. BERMAN 
U.S.D.J. 
Yesterday, I was provided a paiiial transcript of the August 27, 2019 hearing in the above-
captioned case, and I am writing to clarify the record. 
As you know, I co-authored a New Yark Law Journal article before the hearing. The transcript 
quotes the court, in pertinent part, as follows with reference to me and the article: "On a somewhat more 
serious note, don't quote me on this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of that article is 
himself counsel in one of the Epstein-related cases. I was surprised to learn that very recently. I'm 
certain it is true. I was also surprised that that aspect was not disclosed in the Law Journal." Later in the 
hearing, attorney David Boies made comments consistent with those of the court. 
Just to clear up the evident misunderstanding: I have never been counsel to Epstein or his estate 
or to anyone in an Epstein-related case. I did serve as an expert witness, by way of expert declaration, in 
support of Professor Dershowitz's motion to disqualify Mr. Boies and his law firm in Giuffre v. 
Dershowitz, 1: l 9-cv-03377 (SDNY), a pending defamation case that might be described as "Epstein-
related." My work as an expert witness, which concluded in June, did not involve my representation of, 
or advocacy on behalf of, Professor Dershowitz. I did not serve as counsel or as an advocate on 
anyone's behalf in co-authoring the law journal article. 
Very truly yours, 
~ 
Bruce A. Green
