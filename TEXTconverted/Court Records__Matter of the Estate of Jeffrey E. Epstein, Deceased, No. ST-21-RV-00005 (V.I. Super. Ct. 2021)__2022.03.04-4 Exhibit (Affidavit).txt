AFFIDAVIT OF CHRISTOPHER A. KROBLIN 
 
I, Christopher A. Kroblin, Esq., declare and affirm as follows:  
1. 
I am an attorney admitted to practice in New York and the Virgin Islands. 
2. 
I am a 1997 graduate of Lewis & Clark College and a 2002 graduate of Golden 
Gate University School of Law.  I have practiced law in the Virgin Islands since 2005.  Since 
2010, I have been a partner at Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin PLLC (“Kellerhals”), counsel in this 
probate proceeding for the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Epstein 
Estate”), Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn (the “Co-Executors”).   
3. 
I attach as Exhibit A copies of the professional profiles of myself, Shari N. 
D’Andrade, Marjorie Whalen and Andrew Heymann, as posted on the websites of Kellerhals or 
Solomon Blum Heyman LLP (“Solomon”).  Each relevant attorney has reviewed his or her 
profile and confirmed that the statements therein are true and accurate. 
4. 
I attach as Exhibit B a chart showing the contemporaneous time entries of the 
Kellerhals and Solomon professionals relating to the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, as those 
terms are defined in the Motion for Award of Costs and Attorneys’ Fees and Incorporated 
Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof, filed herewith.  The services charged were actually 
and necessarily performed in connection with the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal.

5. 
The hourly rates set forth in Exhibit B are the customary rates charged by each 
attorney listed therein.  Clients customarily pay these rates, and the Epstein Estate pays these 
rates for these firms’ representation of the Co-Executors.   
6. 
The hourly rates set forth in Exhibit B are customary and reasonable for similarly 
experienced attorneys practicing law with firms comparable to Kellerhals and Solomon in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands.
