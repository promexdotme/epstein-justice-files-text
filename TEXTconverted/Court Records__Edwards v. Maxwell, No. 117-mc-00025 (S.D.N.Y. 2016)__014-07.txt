1             (Case called)
2             THE COURT: Extending discovery.
3             MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.  This is Sigrid
4    McCawley on behalf of the plaintiff, and we had filed a motion
5    for additional time to complete six depositions.  Your Honor
6    may recall that we received an order on Monday that allowed for
7    alternative services to three of the witnesses that we were
8    seeking to depose.  Our discovery cutoff right now is set for
9    June 30th, which is I believe next Friday, if I'm correct.  So
10    at present we have six witnesses that we still need to depose,
11    the three that we had alternative service for, and then we have
12    Mr. Ross GOw, who was the defendant's agent who issued the
13    defamatory statement, Mr. Brunel --
14             THE COURT:  How much time do you want?
15             MS. McCAWLEY:  Sorry.  We were requesting 30 days to
16    complete those depositions to coordinate with their counsel and
17    then coordinate with the defendant's counsel and get those set,
18    and I believe we can do that without altering the Court's
19    deadline for a trial, which is set presently for November --
20    I'm sorry, October 17th.
21             THE COURT:  OK.  What is wrong with that?
22             MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, in theory, initially there
23    is nothing wrong with that.  It seems to me that we're not
24    going to complete a variety of discovery issues by July 1.  The
25    problem, I think, your Honor, is the cascading effect of that

1    extension.
2             And if I could digress for a moment and just a moment?
3    When we were here I think in March, the Court raised the issue
4    of was this enough time for discovery at that time.  I told the
5    Court I didn't think so, and I didn't think that the trial date
6    was reasonable as a result of what I perceived to be problems
7    going forward with discovery.  Counsel on the other side
8    opposed my suggestion as to extension of time at that point and
9    we proceeded.  The Court agreed with the plaintiff and not with
10    me.
11             The problem I see, your Honor, is that now we are
12    scheduled to have expert disclosures due in July, dispositive
13    motions in August, and a trial date in October.  I don't
14    believe that it is feasible, if we continue discovery out until
15    the end of July, to have expert discovery done by the end of
16    August.  I don't believe it is going to be feasible to have
17    dispositive motions completed in the time set by the Court, and
18    all of that is going to push into whether or not we have an
19    October 18th trial date.
20             I think the Court also needs to consider, your Honor,
21    and of course is now familiar with the volume of paper that
22    gets filed in this court on a regular basis at all hours of the
23    day and night, and I anticipate that there are going to be
24    significant evidentiary issues that the Court is going to need
25    to rule on in advance of trial.  The Court sees a harbinger of

1    those issues today, I think, as a result of these subpoenas.
2    All of that tells me that the prudent course of action in my
3    view is to sort of try to sit down and rework some of these
4    discovery deadlines with an idea that we're going to actually
5    have realistic dates.
6             THE COURT:  OK.  Good.  I'll extend the deadline 30
7    days.  I'll direct counsel to meet and confer and see if they
8    can come up with a schedule that both sides will agree upon.
9             Second, the plaintiff wants to maintain certain
10    confidentiality designations.  What is the problem?
11             MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.
12             So, with respect to our revised Rule 26 disclosures,
13    we, in order to divulge all information relevant to the case,
14    had a list of individuals on there who are allegedly victims of
15    sexual abuse themselves as minors or witnessed things.  So we
16    designated under our protective order in this case that Rule 26
17    disclosure as confidential.  It was challenged under the
18    Protective Order.  Once it is challenged, we have a ten-day
19    window to file something with the Court.  So we filed our
20    motion for the protective order.
21             On Friday of this past week, on the 17th, they issued
22    a new -- defendants issued a new Rule 26 disclosure with 42 new
23    names on it, those of which were on our disclosures, without
24    marking it as confidential.  So I sent them an email just
25    asking them to hold that as confidential until the Court has an
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

1    opportunity to rule on whether or not those names can remain
2    confidential under the protective order.  So that is the status
3    as we are right now.
4             So we are awaiting a ruling.  We believe those
5    individuals should be protected under the Court's protective
6    order and those names kept confidential during the course of
7    this, and it is my understanding that defendants oppose that
8    position.
9             THE COURT:  What is the attack?
10             MR. PAGLIUCA:  Well, your Honor, under the terms of
11    the protective order, certain categories of information is
12    likely confidential.  People's names, in my view, are not
13    confidential.  I didn't choose to list these folks in what I
14    understand is a Rule 26(a) disclosure, which is a good faith
15    disclosure of people who may have information relevant to the
16    claims or defenses in the case.  That's their listing.  All it
17    is is the names of people.
18             I have absolutely no idea or ability to understand why
19    someone's name could be considered to be confidential.  It is
20    their name.  They use it every day.  They walk around with it.
21    They have a driver's license with it.  I don't understand how
22    names in a 26A(a) disclosure could be deemed confidential.
23             And what I view this as is just simply, you know,
24    another step in the process here of preventing access and use
25    of information.

1             THE COURT:  Well, you've got the information.
2             MR. PAGLIUCA:  I do have the information.
3             THE COURT:  Yes.
4             MR. PAGLIUCA:  Why is it confidential?
5             THE COURT:  Why?
6             MS. McCAWLEY:  May I address that, your Honor?  Did
7    you want me to address that?
8             THE COURT:  Yes.
9             MS. McCAWLEY:  Sorry.  So with respect to the reason
10    why individuals who may have been victims of sexual assault
11    would be confidential, there is case law that we cite in our
12    brief, Doby v. Evans, which deals with using, for example,
13    pseudonyms of victims --
14             THE COURT:  Let's just -- I think we can shorthand in
15    the context of the patois of this case.
16             Victims.  OK.  You want to maintain the
17    confidentiality of the identity of the victims.  OK?
18             MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.
19             THE COURT:  Beyond that?
20             MS. McCAWLEY:  Right.  Beyond that we are fine.
21             THE COURT:  OK.  All right.  That will be maintained.
22             MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you.
23             THE COURT:  Apple and Microsoft.  Let me ask the
24    defense, seems to me the law bars the subpoenas.
25             MR. PAGLIUCA:  I don't understand why, your Honor.  I

1    think it's a legitimate Rule 45 subpoena.  I don't understand
2    why it would be barred under Rule 45.  There is no objection by
3    the providers of the information.  They have indicated to us
4    that if there is a release that's provided to them by the
5    plaintiff, they will turn over the information.  And I don't
6    understand what the problem is.  This is information indeed,
7    your Honor, that the plaintiffs are required to produce to us
8    under our discovery requests and have not, which resulted in
9    these Rule 45 subpoenas.  After the Rule 45 --
10             THE COURT:  Well, as far as Apple, my understanding
11    about Apple is that with respect to that, that material has
12    been reviewed by counsel and everything has been turned over
13    that's appropriate.
14             MS. SCHULTZ:  That is correct, your Honor.
15             MR. PAGLIUCA:  Well, if that's true, your Honor, then
16    the issue is moot and I agree.
17             THE COURT:  If what?
18             MR. PAGLIUCA:  The issue is moot if that is true.
19             THE COURT:  So Apple is out.
20             Now, the problem with Microsoft, I'm not quite clear.
21             MR. PAGLIUCA:  The problem for me or the problem for
22    them?

1    Giuffre.  My client had two email accounts with Microsoft.
2    They are personal emails accounts.  We have not been able to
3    access that.
4             THE COURT:  Why not?
5             MS. SCHULTZ:  Well, it appears for one -- there is one
6    called live.com, and it appears for that, that that has been
7    administratively deleted.  I don't have personal knowledge of
8    that, but when you put in the email address to try to recover
9    it, I get a message saying we don't recognize this one, "this
10    one" being the email address.  That is Exhibit 1 to our brief
11    on this matter.
12             We wrote a letter to opposing counsel citing some
13    governing provisions of Microsoft's email policy that indicates
14    that due to inactivity they delete accounts after a certain
15    amount of time.  It's my understanding that that has happened
16    to that account but I can't say so for sure.  So we are unable
17    to access that whatsoever.
18             The second account is a hotmail.com account.  We have
19    also been unable to access that.  It appears that it still
20    exists, but despite multiple and diligent attempts to get into
21    that account, we have been unable to.  And I have been involved
22    in those attempts myself personally.  Accordingly, we have
23    captured and produced every electronic document to which we
24    have access.
25             And I'd like to speak a minute about the legality of

1    the Microsoft subpoena.  Even under Rule 26, it is a hopelessly
2    broad subpoena.  It is abusive civil discovery and on the face
3    of it appears to violate the Electronic Communications Privacy
4    Act and the Stored Communications Act, federal laws.  The email
5    seeks -- excuse me.  The subpoena seeks every email that has
6    ever been sent to that account or sent from that account.
7    That's every single personal email.  This is without
8    limitations, without exceptions, without a timeline.  And
9    pursuant to these subpoenas, these emails are to be turned over
10    to defense counsel.  So, plaintiff's counsel would not have an
11    opportunity to review for attorney-client privilege email,
12    review for relevance, and it wholly circumvents the protections
13    of the discovery process, which is why courts who have looked
14    at this issue have consistently rejected these broad subpoenas.
15             Defendants know that they are not entitled to every
16    single personal email plaintiff has ever sent or ever received
17    in the course of however many years these accounts were open.
18    In fact, Judge Kozinski in the Ninth Circuit allowed a civil
19    suit against those who propounded these improper subpoenas, and
20    that was with regard to a professional email account, as
21    opposed to personal email accounts, the issue in this case
22             THE COURT:  Do we know what the date of this account
23    is?
24             MS. SCHULTZ:  It's an old account.  I think, 2011 -- I
25    know that it was -- at least one of them was active in 2011.

1    It's impossible for me to determine at this point when it was
2    opened and when it was last used because we don't have access
3    to them.
4             THE COURT:  Yes.  OK.
5             MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, this is the problem and I'm
6    going to be frank.  This is a hide-the-ball problem.  They tell
7    us -- so let me backup.
8             We were originally told these are the only email
9    accounts that the plaintiff had.  When we deposed her, we found
10    out about these accounts.  We then get into an issue with
11    counsel telling us, oh, we've done this due diligence search
12    and we can't access any of this information, these accounts are
13    closed.  Well, then we look into it a little bit further and we
14    find out, indeed, the accounts are not closed; indeed, they
15    have been active, and there are indeed emails that are relevant
16    to the issues in this case that were sent and received out of
17    these accounts.  That's a fact here.
18             Now, all they need to do, if they want to avoid
19    electronic privacy issues, is comply with their discovery
20    obligations, execute a release, and send it to Microsoft.
21    Microsoft will then give them the information.  That's what we
22    have been told in response to this subpoena.
23             So to sit here and say, oh, it's overbroad and it's a
24    problem and you can't do it, you know, you can't have it both
25    ways.  You either can't avoid discovery of something that you

3             I'm sorry we are here at this point.  I agree, if
4    there is privileged information in there, maybe somebody should
5    review it.  But when you tell opposing counsel we don't have
6    access to it and the account is closed and that's indeed not
7    true, it seems to me that you have forfeited your ability to
8    then stand up and say the subpoena is overbroad.
9             THE COURT:  Forgive me, but what's the basis upon
10    which you say it's not true?
11             MR. PAGLIUCA:  The account is not closed?
12             THE COURT:  Yes.
13             MR. PAGLIUCA:  Because we have been told that by
14    Microsoft when we issued them the subpoena.
15             MS. SCHULTZ:  Can I address that really briefly?
16             My communications regarding these accounts are in
17    letters that are attached to the briefs in this case.  I never
18    said that the Hotmail account was closed.  I said that we are
19    unable to access it.
20             With regard to the Live.com account, I said it appears
21    to be closed because the website does not recognize the email
22    address.  I never told them that the accounts were closed.
23             I am more than happy to sign a release to Microsoft

11             MR. FEDER:  Good afternoon.  My name is Eric Feder
12    from Davis Wright Tremaine, for the movant, Sharon Churcher.
13             My client, Sharon Churcher, is a journalist.  She is
14    currently employed by American Media, Inc., where she is a
15    reporter for Radar Online and the National Inquirer.  And prior
16    to that she worked at the British newspaper, The Mail on
17    Sunday. She's also worked as a freelance reporter.  And she
18    has been subpoenaed as a third party here to give testimony and
19    to provide documents in this case.  We move to quash the
20    subpoena.
21             As Ms. Churcher states in her affidavit in support of
22    the motion, her entire involvement with this case, with the
23    plaintiff, with the defendant, all of the facts underlying the
24    case was as a reporter seeking to report and publish news
25    stories.  All the documents and the information described in

1    the subpoena and the document requests, which are quite broad,
2    by the way, and which we have to assume provide the contours of
3    the information they are seeking in deposition, were created or
4    obtained by Ms. Churcher in the course of her news-gathering
5    activities, and much of the information sought was communicated
6    in confidence, as well.  So under the New York State Shield
7    Law, which is the appropriate law and which defendants
8    acknowledge is the appropriate law, not the slightly less
9    protective Federal Reporters' privilege, the defendant has a
10    heavy burden to meet to even obtain nonconfidential
11    information, and confidential information is absolutely
12    privileged.
13             We just received an opposition to our motion which was
14    filed last night after close of business and we've been
15    reviewing it, but much of the substance of it is redacted out
16    pursuant, presumably, to the protective order.  We had
17    previously offered defense counsel to sign the acknowledgment
18    of the protective order, which does provide for disclosure to
19    witnesses and witnesses' counsel.  They didn't take us up on it
20    before.  Obviously, the offer still stands.
21             But what we can say based on what we've seen is that
22    the defendant claims that Ms. Churcher, who they fully
23    acknowledge reported stories about this case -- not this
24    litigation but the underlying case and who first met the
25    plaintiff when she traveled to Australia to interview her in

1    2011, that she at some point along the way transformed from a
2    reporter reporting news into a friend or a business adviser.
3    It's not clear again because of the redactions when this
4    transformation presumably took place.  But the reality is that
5    that is simply an incorrect characterization of the
6    relationship.
7             Since 2011, and continuing up, frankly, through the
8    present day, Ms. Churcher has continued to cover this story as
9    a reporter, has published stories, including just I think two
10    months ago, often using "Virginia" or her so-called agents as
11    sources, of course most prominently in early 2015, which is
12    what underlies this particular litigation.
13             By its terms, the Shield Law applies to any
14    information obtained or communications made, quote, in the
15    course of gathering or obtaining news for publication.  Now, of
16    course, a reporter's source relationship is complicated.  Not
17    every single interaction or every single communication is going
18    to be an interview with questions and answers that then get
19    published verbatim.  So to the extent that there are particular
20    emails where Sharon provided advice to Virginia, that doesn't
21    transform the overall relationship from reporter and source to
22    adviser and advisee or friend.
23             Reporters communicate with sources in a variety of
24    ways.  A police beat reporter may take a sergeant out for
25    drinks and talk about life in general with no intention of

1    publishing details but with the intention of maintaining that
2    close source relationship so that when the sergeant comes into
3    possession of information, he's right there as the first
4    recipient of that information.
5             As this Court stated in the Schoolcraft case, that the
6    reporter's privilege seeks to prevent the unnecessary enmeshing
7    of the press in litigation that arises from events they cover.
8    And that's exactly what this is.
9             The Second Circuit interprets the qualified privilege
10    very broadly to apply not only to individual bits of
11    information gathered from sources but also to unpublished
12    details of the news gathering process.  That's from the Baker
13    v. Goldman Sachs case, 669 F.3d 105, from 2012.
14             But either way, what they're seeking here, as
15    described in their opposition, is quintessential news gathering
16    Shield Law material.  They list it at a couple of different
17    points in their brief.  They are asking for Sharon Churcher's
18    interview notes, recordings, memos, and other documentation
19    that are clearly, and concededly by the defendant, from the
20    news gathering process.
21             In order to overcome this Shield Law for even the
22    nonconfidential information, they have to make a clear and
23    specific showing that the information is highly material and
24    relevant, that it's critical or necessary to the maintenance of
25    the claim or defense, and that it is not obtainable from any

1    alternate sources.  So as an initial point, it is quite clear
2    that they haven't exhausted all other sources up to and
3    including the proceedings here today, where they are continuing
4    to seek material from the plaintiff's email accounts, which
5    your Honor just granted an order that would facilitate that,
6    and also the pending motion to reopen plaintiff's deposition.
7    So clearly they haven't exhausted plaintiff as a source.
8             They are also asking for Ms. Churcher's communications
9    with the plaintiff's agents or attorneys or communications with
10    law enforcement about the plaintiff, but we're not aware of any
11    effort to obtain that information from those agents and
12    attorneys or from law enforcement.  Obviously, law enforcement
13    may have their own objections to a subpoena.  And while the
14    defendants may not like what the FBI would say here, but there
15    are certainly alternative sources that they are required under
16    the Shield Law to turn to before seeking this from a reporter.
17             In addition, the information -- again, we haven't seen
18    precisely what it is because it is blacked out of their
19    opposition but to the extent we understand it -- does not meet
20    the critical or necessary prong, which is, under the Second
21    Circuit law and under New York law, quite high.  As the Second
22    Circuit articulated in Krase v. Graco, 79 F.3d 346, the
23    information can be compelled, or disclosure can be compelled
24    when the claim or defense, quote, virtually rises or falls with
25    the admission or exclusion of the proffered evidence.  And they

1    just -- they have not made that showing here.
2             They talk about the fact that they need this
3    information because the credibility of the plaintiff is key,
4    but the credibility of a plaintiff is key in many kinds of
5    cases and certainly very often in libel case, where truth or
6    falsity is sort of the ultimate issue being tried, and there is
7    obviously not a wholesale exception for libel or any case where
8    the plaintiff's credibility is central to the Shield Law.
9             They also focus heavily on the idea that the story
10    changed over time from what was published in 2011 and what was
11    published in 2015 and after and, in particular, the question of
12    whether Virginia had sex with Prince Andrew or not.  In 2011,
13    the article stated that there was not evidence that that
14    happened.  In 2015, after court papers stated that it had
15    happened, they then reported that it had.  But I would submit
16    that's less an issue of the story changing than what changed
17    was what the newspapers were comfortable publishing.
18             There is actually a Vanity Fair article about this
19    that was published later in 2011 that talks about how -- it
20    talks about Prince Andrew -- that's what the article is
21    about -- and it talks about the strictness of British libel
22    laws that likely are what contributed to newspapers sort of
23    hedging on that point.
24             This also is not a case where the journalist was an
25    eyewitness to events in her capacity as a citizen.  She wasn't

1    there when whatever happened with Ms. Maxwell and Ms. Giuffre
2    took place, witnessing it as citizen Sharon Churcher.  All of
3    her knowledge about this comes from reporting as a reporter.
4             And, finally, because the documents all fall within
5    the Shield Law, a reporter should not be burdened with going
6    and sitting for a deposition where her counsel basically
7    objects to every question as privileged under the Shield Law.
8    And both the New York Court of Appeals and the Second Circuit
9    have emphasized that.  The New York Court of Appeals said, in
10    Holmes v. Winter, which we cite in our brief, where the entire
11    focus of a reporter's testimony would be on privileged topics,
12    quote, No legitimate purpose would be served by requiring a
13    witness to go through the formality of appearing to testify
14    only to refuse to answer questions concerning the information
15    sought.
16             And the Second Circuit, in Gonzalez, talked about the
17    dangers that if parties to a lawsuit were free to subpoena the
18    press at will, it would become standard operating procedure,
19    and the resulting wholesale exposure of press files to
20    litigants' scrutiny would burden the press with heavy costs of
21    subpoena compliance and could otherwise impair its ability to
22    perform its duties.
23             Finally, even setting aside the Shield Law, the scope
24    of the subpoena is very broad and overly burdensome even just
25    as a third party.  These communications go back at least five

1    years, if not more.  Ms. Churcher was employed at different
2    newspapers and is a freelancer, so we are talking about
3    multiple email accounts.  So even just gathering this broad
4    scope of communications which aren't limited by time or
5    specific subject matter would be quite burdensome, but, again,
6    because the Shield Law applies, a fortiori, as a journalist,
7    she should not be put to that burden.

5    it's Sharon.  I wanted to discuss and with you on a deep

12             This voice message is troubling on a number of levels,

20    first-name basis.  She is feeling free to call him and leave
21    messages for him.

1    plaintiff.  That's troubling as well because we went through
2    litigation in this case about our access to alleged
3    public-interest privileged documents that were not turned over
4    to us but were submitted in camera to the Court.  But to the
5    extent that that's part of those documents and Ms. Churcher has
6    it, that's a problem for the discovery process in this case.
7             And it's a problem for Ms. Churcher, your Honor,
8    because it's clear, as is attached to our papers, that
9    Ms. Churcher's role in this entire ordeal was not simply a
10    journalist.  Ms. Churcher is a self-described friend.  She is a
11    self-described adviser.  She's a self-described confidante.
12    She is a self-described advocate.  In many instances throughout
13    this ordeal, Ms. Churcher was acting as a source of information
14    to Mr. Edwards, who is another lawyer who has entered an
15    appearance in this case, and to law enforcement.
16             The Shield Law only applies when journalists are asked
17    to disclose information received in the course of gathering or
18    obtaining news for publication.  And Ms. Churcher's activities
19    in connection with this case are far outside of those bounds.
20    To be clear, we don't want that information from Ms. Churcher.
21    So whatever information Ms. Churcher has that was indeed
22    obtained in her job in the course of gathering or obtaining
23    news for publication, we haven't subpoenaed that information.
24             But I suggest, your Honor, that the blanket notion
25    that Ms. Churcher can't sit for a deposition in this case is

1    simply wrong, and these issues need to be resolved on a
2    question-and-answer basis by Ms. Churcher, because her role in
3    connection with this case far exceeded any role as a
4    journalist.
5             Indeed, your Honor, Ms. Churcher is a fact witness in
6    this case.  The Shield Law relied on is only applicable when
7    the journalist is asked to disclose information, again,
8    received in the course of gathering or obtaining news for
9    publication.  And much of the information that we are asking --
10    if, indeed, it is not all -- from Ms. Churcher has nothing to
11    do with information she gathered or collected in the course of
12    gathering news for publication.
13             We have Ms. Churcher meeting with the plaintiff in
14    early 2011 and then conducting a week-long series of interviews
15    leading to the publications in March of 2011.  We then go
16    through another five years here where the story changes, and it
17    is reasonable, I believe, to believe that the story is changing
18    not because of the truth of the story but because of
19    information that's being given to the plaintiff and she is then
20    changing her story to make it more salacious and more sellable
21    to various people through the world.
22             There is a series of exchanges between the plaintiff
23    and Ms. Churcher that we have in email communications that have
24    been provided to the Court that demonstrate this course of
25    conduct over time.  We also have a series of communications

1    between the plaintiff and law enforcement and the plaintiff's
2    lawyers that are not news-gathering activities.  These are
3    wholly outside of the process of gathering news.  And they are
4    sharing information back and forth, and Ms. Churcher is
5    providing information to Mr. Edwards, counsel in this case.
6    Ms. Churcher is advising the plaintiff on how to deal with her
7    own lawyer in connection with maximizing her return on
8    publishing details that appear to be provided to the plaintiff
9    by Ms. Churcher.  All of this is outside the bounds of any
10    Shield Law or any privilege.
11             I think the Court knows -- I'm sure the Court is
12    exhausted with all of the pleadings that have been filed in
13    this case related to discovery.  I believe we have exhausted
14    all avenues available to us to obtain this information.  There
15    is really no place else to go.  And so there is -- I think it
16    is not well founded, your Honor, that there is some notion that
17    we have not done everything that we can to get this information
18    from the plaintiff, Microsoft, other places before turning to a
19    subpoena to Ms. Churcher.
20             Ms. Churcher is likely the only source of this highly
21    relevant information, which is this 24-page fabricated diary
22    and the testimony around that, communications with law
23    enforcement and the FBI that have no legitimate investigative
24    reporter purpose.

9             MR. FEDER:  May I be heard briefly?
10             THE COURT:  Mm-hmm.
11             MR. FEDER:  Thank you.  Just very briefly.
12             First of all, the voicemail that my colleague read is
13    totally consistent with news gathering.  She mentions that it's
14    on deep background, and in trying to cultivate the source she
15    describes herself as almost a friend.  Again, I don't think
16    that type of less formal communication is indicative of a
17    transformation from a journalist into something else.
18             But more problematically, we haven't heard that
19    voicemail.  We haven't seen any of the emails they are talking
20    about because they are redacted; the exhibits containing them
21    were filed under seal.  So we don't know exactly which pieces
22    of information they are trying to seek and which pieces of
23    information they are claiming are not subject to the privilege.
24             I think we can all agree that Ms. Churcher is in fact
25    a journalist, that she did in fact publish stories from
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

1    actually going back to 2007 that Virginia wasn't named, but
2    from 2007 and certainly 2011 onward, publishing stories about
3    these matters.  So, clearly the Shield Law is floating around
4    here at a minimum somewhere.
5             And they have to make a clear and specific showing for
6    each piece of information that they claim either the Shield Law
7    doesn't apply because she wasn't acting in her capacity as a
8    journalist or that the Shield Law is overcome because it's
9    critical or necessary and they've exhausted alternative
10    sources.  And the Shield Law itself provides that the Court
11    shall order disclosure only of such portions of the news sought
12    as to which the above-described showing has been made and shall
13    support such order with clear and specific findings made after
14    a hearing.
15             So we can't go forward and just deny the motion to
16    quash entirely and just go to a deposition and start answering
17    questions when the Shield Law at a minimum applies to, we would
18    submit, all of it but at a minimum a substantial portion of the
19    information.  We need to see what they're specifically talking
20    about here.

1             MR. POE:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Gregory Poe on
2    behalf of non-party Jeffrey Epstein.  With me, your Honor, is
3    my colleague Rachel Li Wai Suen.
4             THE COURT:  Yes.
5             MR. POE:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you.
6             We've attempted to be thorough in our briefing so I
7    won't belabor the issues.  I think the key issue is whether in
8    fact an undue burden would exist if Mr. Epstein were subjected
9    at this point to a deposition.  The plaintiff concedes, as the
10    law requires, that evidence must be relevant and admissible.
11    And here the examples the plaintiff's counsel has offered with
12    respect to a 2010 deposition in a different proceeding where
13    Mr. Epstein apparently answered some questions doesn't add
14    anything that the public record already doesn't reveal.  So, in
15    our view, that would not justify a deposition, which leaves
16    really the Fifth Amendment implications that have been
17    represented will be made, and that raises the LiButti issue.
18             And under LiButti, your Honor, really the permeating
19    factor is control.  And the typical case -- really, most of the
20    cases, to the extent courts have addressed this issue, are
21    employee invocations where the corporation for which the
22    employee works is the party, and there the invocation can be
23    imputed because it is controlled.  There is no control here,
24    and the factors that exist don't justify the deposition under
25    the LiButti analysis.  And I would point the Court, as I'm sure
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

1    the Court has reviewed, to docket 228 -- that's the defendant's
2    pleading -- at pages 16 to 18, which lays out both in redacted
3    form, which I have not reviewed, and unredacted form, various
4    bases for why LiButti has not been met here by the plaintiff.
5             But the alternative argument the plaintiff makes,
6    which is this is not ripe for decision, while we certainly
7    concede that it would not be something that is the usual
8    practice in a typical case, this is not a typical case, we
9    would respectfully submit.  And we would ask the Court consider
10    as an alternative holding in abeyance any deposition of
11    Mr. Epstein until the record that the plaintiff refers to has
12    been developed.  That would not result in prejudice to either
13    party, and it would not subject Mr. Epstein to a burden of a
14    deposition or the cost or inconvenience, which, of course, need
15    to be considered with respect to a third party under Rule 45,
16    when, in fact, if we are correct that no litigation purpose
17    would be served, it would by definition, in our view, be an
18    unnecessary cost and inconvenience and, therefore, an undue
19    burden.
20             Finally, your Honor, if the Court -- and, ultimately,
21    if Mr. Epstein is not granted relief with respect to this
22    motion, we would ask in the alternative that the Court prohibit
23    videography for the reasons that we have outlined in our
24    briefs.  The plaintiff's opposition states that Mr. Epstein is
25    asking for preferential treatment.  We make legal arguments,

1    your Honor.  Whether the Court agrees or disagrees with our
2    legal arguments, Mr. Epstein is not asking to be treated better
3    or worse than anybody else under the law.
4             So with that, your Honor, we -- if the Court has any
5    questions, I am prepared to answer them.
6             THE COURT:  Thank you.
7             MR. POE:  Thank you.
8             MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, may I be heard on the
9    motion to quash, please?
10             So with respect to Mr. Epstein, obviously the Court
11    has heard from us previously.  He is at the center of this
12    conspiracy, we allege, with Ms. Maxwell, the defendant.  It
13    would be highly prejudicial to the plaintiff here to not be
14    able to take his deposition.
15             To accommodate his concerns, even though he was
16    sighted just even days ago by his New York mansion, we have
17    agreed to fly down to the U.S. Virgin Islands to handle that
18    deposition.
19             With respect to his concerns over videography, he said
20    he was concerned that that would be leaked to the media, we
21    have a confidentiality order in place in this case and we will
22    gladly mark that as confidential so that is not a concern.
23             It's very important that we are entitled to ask him
24    those questions.  I know his counsel has stated that he intends
25    to take the Fifth.  As the Court well knows, there are many
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

1    questions for which you have to have a basis to take the Fifth,
2    so it can't be just a carte blanche taking of the Fifth.  So
3    there will be questions that he can answer during that
4    deposition.
5             In addition, we're entitled to see his demeanor during
6    that, to have the jury see his demeanor on video if this goes
7    to trial.  So it's critical that we are entitled to take that
8    deposition of Mr. Epstein, who is the co-conspirator here.
9             With respect to the LiButti case, your Honor, that
10    case addresses, as the Court may well know -- it is a Second
11    Circuit case -- it addresses the standard by which a court can
12    allow a nonparty's invocation of the Fifth Amendment to have an
13    adverse inference against a party in a litigation.  We contend
14    that we meet all of the factors of LiButti, but at this point
15    that would not be the time for the Court to make that decision.
16    Obviously, the deposition needs to take place.  We need to have
17    a record of what he is taking the Fifth on, and then we can
18    make those arguments presumably in a motion in limine for why
19    we believe that that adverse inference should apply.
20             So, your Honor, I submit to you that this deposition
21    is critical to us.  We've done our part in trying to
22    accommodate this witness, and we believe that the deposition
23    should move forward and the motion to quash should be denied.

2             THE COURT:  Yes.
3             MR. PAGLIUCA:  Thank you.
4             Your Honor, first, I think what I'd like to say to the
5    Court is that, indeed, I wish Mr. Epstein's deposition could go
6    forward.  I have every reason to expect that should Mr. Epstein
7    testify and testify truthfully, his testimony would be of
8    enormous support and corroboration of Ms. Maxwell's version of
9    events in this case.
10             It's important to note, your Honor, that Ms. Maxwell
11    was not the subject of this investigation that led to
12    Mr. Epstein's being charged and pleading guilty.  We just
13    finished the deposition of Detective Recarey, who was the lead
14    deposition -- the lead detective in the case, and he agreed
15    that throughout this investigation he never spoke to
16    Ms. Maxwell.  No one identified Ms. Maxwell as being involved
17    in any of the alleged crimes.  He did not seek any indictment
18    or prosecution against Ms. Maxwell.  And his only investigation
19    relative to Ms. Maxwell was to simply look her up on the
20    Internet.
21             There is no surveillance footage of Ms. Maxwell.  She
22    is not named in any of the affidavits that are filed with the
23    court.  So, in short, Ms. Maxwell was not implicated in any of
24    the conduct that Mr. Epstein was alleged to have committed.
25             It's important background, your Honor, for the next

1    point here, because the plaintiff has not raised what I think
2    is a very important issue here with regard to the Fifth
3    Amendment, and that is does Mr. Epstein indeed have the ability
4    to assert a Fifth Amendment privilege now in the context of
5    this litigation.  And there are a number of factors that are
6    considered, the first being, and I think it is important to
7    recognize, Mr. Epstein was granted immunity by the United
8    States Attorney in the District of Florida for the conduct that
9    I believe he is going to be questioned about.  And I don't
10    believe that it is appropriate for a witness to assert a Fifth
11    Amendment privilege after they have been granted immunity by
12    the prosecuting authority under 18 United States Code 6001.
13    So, I don't think that there has been any exploration of
14    whether Mr. Epstein can indeed invoke his Fifth Amendment
15    privilege.
16             He also pled guilty to state charges which likely
17    would act as a jeopardy bar and prohibit Mr. Epstein from
18    asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege in the state system to
19    the extent that the immunity from the federal government
20    doesn't cover him, which I submit that it would.
21             There is also the statute of limitations, your Honor,
22    which seems to me has long expired with regard to any of the
23    allegations in this case.
24             Now, why do I raise that, Judge?  They don't really

1    to be able to have him assert his Fifth Amendment privilege so
2    that they can then try to back-door this against Ms. Maxwell.
3    And, in effect, they are creating their own little dichotomy
4    here, which is he's taking the Fifth, we want him to take the
5    Fifth, because then we get to just do a list of questions about
6    everything that we want to have an adverse inference about as
7    it relates to Ms. Maxwell, not as to Mr. Epstein.  That is the
8    problem, because they haven't done what they should do to get
9    to that point in the first place.  I think that is a real issue
10    and a real problem for this motion before the Court now.
11             This is simply an attempt to manufacture -- and I use
12   that word deliberately, your Honor -- manufacture self-serving
13    evidence that they can then try to present to a jury through
14    this derivative adverse inference.
15             Final comment:  I have never had a court allow a
16    witness to come into court and assert a Fifth Amendment
17    privilege, whether that be in a criminal case or a civil case.
18    I've never had a court allow a jury to be shown someone's
19    deposition while they are asserting a Fifth Amendment
20    privilege.  I don't understand the point of that.  And it seems
21    to me there is no point in allowing a videotaped deposition of
22    somebody who is going to sit there and say to every question
23    "On the advice of my counsel, I assert my Fifth Amendment
24    privilege."  There is nothing to be served by the added expense
25    of that process.

1             So, your Honor, this is Mr. Epstein's fight, it is not
2    Ms. Maxwell's fight, but it becomes Ms. Maxwell's fight to the
3    extent that we're trying to create evidence down the road that
4    is used against Ms. Maxwell in this proceeding.
5             Thank you.
6             THE COURT:  Thank you.
7             Yes.  Anything further?
8             MR. POE:  Nothing further, your Honor.  Thank you.
9             MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, may I just briefly
10    address -- defendant's counsel didn't file a brief on this so I
11    just want to take a few moments to address the points he has
12    just raised very briefly.
13             First, we would love to have Mr. Epstein give complete
14    testimony in this case.  I look forward to that.  I hope that
15    he will do that for us, and that is why we want to take his
16    deposition.  Ms. Maxwell had given an indication she was going
17    to take the Fifth.  When we deposed her, she didn't.  So things
18    may change.  We need his deposition.
19             Second, with respect to the representations regarding
20    the deposition of Detective Recarey which occurred earlier this
21    week, Detective Recarey did say that he sought to interview
22    Ms. Maxwell in the course of that and did acknowledge that
23    Ms. Maxwell is in the police reports.  I just want to make sure
24    that that is corrected on the record.
25             Thank you, your Honor.
