DECLARATION OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT TIMOTHY R. SLATER 
TIMOTHY R. SLATER declares as follows: 
I. 
I am a Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), currently assigned as a 
Section Chief at FBI Headquarters, Washington, D.C. I was appointed a Special Agent in May 
1999. Upon graduation from the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia, in September I 999, I was 
assigned to the Detroit Field Office. I was subsequently transferred to the FBI Miami Field 
Office in May 2006. 
2. In 2006, I was assigned to work on an investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, who was 
accused of sexually abusing many young girls under the age of 18. In the course of our 
investigation, the FBI identified many potential victims of sexual abuse by Epstein. We obtained 
names by speaking to other victims, who frequently knew of friends who had also been paid 
money by Epstein to provide sexual services to him. 
3. One of the victims identified was 
In January - February 2007, I 
used various computer indices to try and locate Ms.- By using these indices and other 
means, I found two international phone numbers which I believed were being used by Ms.

4. Sometime during January - February 2007, I called the one of the numbers, in an 
attempt to speak to Ms.-
Also in my office was FBI Special Agent Nesbitt E. 
Kuyrkendall, the lead agent for the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. I was not using a 
speakerphone when I spoke with Ms.- I asked SIA Kuyrkendall to be present because 
she, as the lead agent, was thoroughly versed in the details of the entire investigation, and I might 
need her assistance to respond to a question posed by Ms.-
that I was unable to answer. 
5. When I dialed the number, a young woman answered the phone. I told her my name, 
identified myself as a Special Agent with the FBI, and asked if she was 
She 
said yes. I used a technique which I employ when speaking to people on the phone, who might 
question whether Jam truly an FBI agent. I provided her with the phone number of the FBI 
Field Office in Miami, Florida, and told ·her she could hang up and verify the number. She 
could then call me back at the number, and her call would be routed to me. Ms. -
said that 
would not be necessary. 
6. I told Ms. -
about our investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, and the allegations that 
Epstein had sexually abused many underage young girls. I told her we believed she might be a 
victim of sexual abuse by Epstein. 
7. Ms.-
answered basic questions, telling me that she did know Jeffrey Epstein. 
She quickly became uncomfortable, telling me she moved away to distance herself from this 
situation, and expressing her desire to "let this be in my past." She asked that l not bother her 
with this again. 
8. I thanked Ms. -
and told her J appreciated her time. 1 provided my name and 
encouraged her to call the FBI Miami Field Office, if she had any questions or needed assistance.
